Map of US with new post-Dobbs abortion restrictions. Expands the scope of criminal liability for pregnancy loss.

Dobbs opened the door let states expand the criminalization of pregnancy loss and abortion.

New post-dobbs bans include a mix of civil and criminal penalties BUT perhaps more importantly by restricting access to legal abortion the result will be more SMA.

The end of Roe effectively transforms all pregnant people's bodies into sites of criminal suspicion, subject to (even more) state surveillance and policing.

The reasons pregnant people have already faced criminal charges are varied and terrifying: surviving violence that resulted in pregnancy loss, experiencing stillbirth and "improperly" disposing of fetal remains, choosing to have a home birth and experiencing complications, even just Googling medication abortion pills.

A pregnant person could also be criminalized for eating poppyseeds and testing positive for substance use.

## End of Pregnancy as Moral Transgression


To determine whether an agentâ€™s behavior is wrong, punishable, and blameworthy, people mainly rely on two key factors: intention and outcome. 


## Fourth Amendment

![](images/procedural.svg){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

## But what protections exist without Roe?

![](images/pregnant_people.svg){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Understandably, focus of abortion debate and scholarship is on the implications of limiting access to legal abortion care.

This rapid expansion of the scope of criminal liability for abortion raises important questions about how other Constitutional privacy protections, including the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable government searches and seizures, will protect people who experience pregnancy loss in the wake of Dobbs.

For example, which facts and circumstances can be used to draw inferences about the cause of a person's pregnancy loss? How do legal actors---including police, judges, prosecutors, and even child welfare workers---make these inferences and approach decisions about which pregnancy losses to investigate as suspected criminal activity? And what factors determine how various officials interpret the meaning of standards like reasonable suspicion or probable cause in this context?

The current proposal will explore these issues and discuss the nature of Fourth Amendment restrictions on criminal investigations of abortion-related activity. It will also discuss psychological research on hindsight bias, social perception, and legal decision-making that could be used to help guide courts in their approach to these cases.

::: notes
-   Lost custody of other children 
- Immigration & deportation 
- Fines & fees, etc. Pregnant people were already being criminalized for the outcome of their own pregnancies before Dobbs. 

Nearly 1,300 people faced criminalization for pregnancy outcomes, including self-managed abortions, between 2006 and 2020. That's triple the amount between 1973, when Roe v. Wade was decided, and 2005 (a period more than twice as long), according to [National Advocates for Pregnant Women](https://www.pregnancyjusticeus.org/arrests-and-prosecutions-of-pregnant-women-1973-2020/).

https://www.ifwhenhow.org/abortion-criminalization-new-research/ Investigations occurred in 26 states despite the fact that only seven states historically criminalized self-managed abortion; today that number is just three (Nevada, South Carolina, and Oklahoma).

This means that overzealous police and prosecutors have circumvented the law's parameters in many states, subtly using criminal laws not meant to apply to allegations of self-managed abortion. Strikingly, regardless of whether these became the final charges, law enforcement considered applying murder or homicide charges in 43% of all 61 cases. These considerations happened twice as frequently in cases involving people of color compared to non-Hispanic white individuals. Racism and stigma infiltrated these investigations and further entrenched them in a crushing criminal process.

Ultimately, the majority of cases proceeded and most often concluded in a guilty plea -- unsurprising given how most cases are resolved in the criminal system. But almost a quarter of the cases were dropped or dismissed by either the prosecutor or court. This should motivate advocates and trained criminal defenders to force a review of the charges so clients aren't wrongly convicted.

For anyone entangled in the criminal process, the harm lasts. Conviction or not, several people lost custody of their children temporarily or permanently. In one case, while local authorities declined to prosecute the woman after acknowledging the self-managed abortion was not unlawful, they still turned her over to immigration authorities for deportation.

Abortions by pill are indistinguishable from involuntary pregnancy loss (miscarriages)

Only distinction is intent

Various legal actors must infer the pregnant person's subjective mental state ("mens rea") to decide whether their actions make them guilty of a crime.

::: notes
We have argued that the folk-concept of punishment is outcome-sensitive, whereas the concept of blame is not. In ordinary life situations and in court, outcome information might thus distort ascriptions of moral or legal culpability.

What, exactly, is it that drives the outcome effect?

Consistent with previous findings, the mediation analysis suggests that the outcome effect on culpability is in large parts a consequence of the hindsight bias (see Kamin & Rachlinski, 1995; Kneer & Machery, 2019; Rachlinski, 1998, Rachlinski, 2000): Participants view the subjective and objective likelihood of possible events that actually come to pass as higher ex post than those that do not come to pass.

In virtue of the higher perceived risk in the unlucky cases (where the harm does occur), people judge the agents as more negligent and (sometimes) more reckless. Consequently (and reasonably), they deem the agent who is viewed as acting more negligently as more blameworthy. Once subjective probability and negligence are accounted for as mediators, however, no significant direct effects of outcome on blame remain.

::: notes
Both sides of abortion debate promote single path narrative of pregnancy - idea that pregnancy ends in live birth unless interrupted by abortion.

For pro-abortion advocates, pregnancy loss and fetal personhood thought to undermine 'choice' narrative. "clump of cells" vs. murder

For anti-abortion forces, pregnancy loss narratives blur the line between abortion and lawful behavior.

3.  My goal is to defend my comprehensive exams during the spring of 2024.

::: notes
My comprehensive literature review will consist of three main sections. First, I will examine the legal principles and case law involving inadmissible outcome information that might affect decisions during criminal investigations and prosecutions of pregnancy-based crimes and the role that outcome information plays in decisions made by legal actors in this context.

Next, I will explore the psychological research that will serve as the theoretical basis for my dissertation. This will include a discussion of the sense-making model of hindsight bias and the closely related literature on the outcome bias.

I will also discuss research exploring whether other social-cognitive processes, such as attributions of blame and responsibility, and moral luck, play a role in these decisions. Finally, I will outline the series of studies that I plan to conduct for my dissertation.
