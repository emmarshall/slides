## Today's Tasks {background-image="images/fitz.png" background-opacity="0.1"}

::: incremental
-   Wrapping up Lab's 1 & 2
-   Today's lab:
    -   Library resources walkthrough
    -   Overview of APA format
    -   Intro to Zotero
    -   Lab 3 Assignment (due next week)
:::

## Reviewing Lab 1 & 2 Activities {.scrollable}

## Operationalization

> Operational definition -- how will you measure it?

-   Spells out precisely how the concept will be measured

## Operationalize

> Describing the steps, procedures & concepts used to identify and measure variables

::: incremental
-   How to define the variables within the language of research?

-   How to measure/observe those variables?

    -   Often look to what others have done
:::

::: aside
**Measurement:** Assigning numbers or labels to units of analysis in order to represent the conceptual properties

## Qualtitative vs. Quantitative Variables

> All observations are qualitative at the outset

::: incremental
-   **Qualitative:** Nonnumerical
-   **Quantitative:** Numerical
-   Both are useful and legitimate
    -   Can choose based on topic or combine aspects of both
:::

## Quantitative Variables {.incremental}

> Discrete vs. Continuous

-   You **count** discrete data
-   You **measure** continuous data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Discrete data

### Continuous data

::: notes
What is Discrete Data? Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you'll count the number of cats.

Discrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.

Examples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country.

## IMDB Rating = Continuous

::: notes
What is Continuous Data? Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.

When you see decimal places for individual values, you're looking at a continuous variable.

Examples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature.

# Lab 3: Bibliographic research

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/types_of_scientific_paper.png){fig-align="center" width="783"}

## Library resources walkthrough

> Don't try to reinvent the wheel!

::: incremental
-   UNL Library tab (on Canvas)
    -   Download ALL the linked handouts & guides
    -   [Powerpoint demo](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19H3m-sIVZJrdI0NuGTayNg0JcdCAi8ok9QeC3RwEp_s/edit#slide=id.g13284654aef_0_9)
    -   [Boolean Searching](https://libguides.usc.edu/searching/boolean)
:::

## Internet-ing as an academic {.incremental}

-   [APA Psych-info](https://unl.libguides.com/az.php?s=14107)
-   [Google Scholar](https://unl.libguides.com/scholar)
-   Be creative!
    -   Faculty websites?
    -   Email authors?


::: aside
If you can't find full text access through Google Scholar, request it via [UNL Libraries' interlibrary loan service](https://unl.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/logon.html). DO THIS!
:::

## IYKYK

::: callout-warning
I am definitely not telling you to use an alternative open-source site like [Sci-hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) because I would never tell you to do that because IP & copyright law is super-duper moral and uncomplicated.
:::

# APA format & Style and Zotero

# Download and install [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

## APA References Assignment

::: callout-tip
-   Use the Zotero handout!
-   Don't try to reinvent the wheel!
:::

## How to get citation

## Bibliographic Assignment {.smaller}

::: incremental

-   Step 1: Locate variables of interest (i.e., Lab 1&2 question 5)
-   Step 2: Find more references! 
-   Step 3: Find EVEN MORE references!
-   Step 4: Identify the larger context in which variables are studied and develop 'search terms'
-   Step 5: Search those terms!
-   Step 6: Find EVEN MORE & MORE references!
-   Step 7: Organize and construct references section

:::

::: callout-note
The goal is to build a section of your final project--taking your time to do this correctly now will save you hours and energy in the future!
