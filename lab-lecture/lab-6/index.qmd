## Review: Research Critiques {.tiny}

[1]{.circle} Hypotheses.

::: {.body .fragment .fade-up .nonincremental}
-   Look for all statements about the research hypothesis.
    -   Remember can be **explicit** or **implied**
:::

[2]{.circle} External validity components.

::: {.body .fragment .fade-up .nonincremental}
-   What looks **good**? What raises **red flags**? What is **unclear**?
    -   Relate **generalizability** back to stated **goals** of study & **pop of interest**
:::

[3]{.circle} Internal validity components.

::: {.body .fragment .fade-up .nonincremental}
-   What looks **good**? What raises **red flags**? What is **unclear**?
    -   Relate **confounds** or **causal** interpretation back to stated goals of study & **design/hypotheses**
:::

## Review: Research Critiques {.tiny}

[4]{.circle} Anything else of interest you find!

::: {.body .fragment .fade-up .nonincremental}
-   Measurement/Construct validity
    -   How did they **operationalize** and **measure** key concepts?
-   Statistical Conclusion validity
    -   Can findings **replicate?**
    -   What about **effect sizes?**
:::

[5]{.circle} ***Review*** your annotations and ***brainstorm*** alternatives.

::: {.body .fragment .fade-up .nonincremental}
-   Make suggestions or identify gaps in knowledge, **do not** always want to change the purpose, hypothesis, or overall design.

## Remember

Your job is to understand/critique the methods & procedures they ***actually*** used, not the ideal study in your head!

:::

::: notes
Have you ever watched dance challenge videos on TikTok? If so, you probably noticed the skill and appearance of the dance model. Some psychologists have started to study how TikTok dance models affect viewers. A set of three studies asked, can the size of the dancer on TikTok influence the body satisfaction of a viewer? Journalists at PsyPost wrote up a summary of this empirical work. The research was originally published in the journal, Computers in Human Behavior; may be paywalled.

## What is the theory

The theory behind the study is related to the potential of social media to impact body esteem:

::: {.body .small .fragmant .fragment-up}
-   Media, especially its portrayal of the "thin ideal" where extremely slim bodies are considered attractive, has a significant impact on shaping these negative body perceptions.
-   With the rise of social media platforms like TikTok, researchers are curious about how this new form of media might influence people's body image.
:::

## Study 1: Overview {.smaller}

::: body
-   Researchers recruited **262 women** aged between 18 and 25 years for an online experiment.
-   Ps **randomly assigned** to watch TikTok videos featuring:
    -   thin dancers
    -   large dancers
    -   videos of animals (control)
-   Both before and after watching the videos, participants rated:
    -   weight satisfaction
    -   overall appearance satisfaction
    -   body shape satisfaction
:::

# Study 1: What **type** of Design? {background-image="images/thin-cow.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

## Study 1: What were the Variables?

::: body
-   Variable Name
-   Levels or scale?
-   Manipulated or measured?
    -   IV or DV or ?? If IV, WG or BG?
:::

## Study 1: What were the Variables?

```{r}

study1 <- data.frame(
  "Variable Name" = c("Dancer size", "Body satisfaction", "State appearance comparison", "Direction of appearance comparison scale", "Social Media Usage"),
  "Levels or scale?" = c("thin/lg/animal", "3-items, 0-100%", "3-items, 1-7 high", "1-5 high better", "6-point, never ➭ 3h"),
  "Manipulated or measured?" = c("Man", "Meas", "Meas", "Meas", "Meas/Control"),
  "IV or DV or ??" = c("IV", "DV", "DV", "DV", "--"),
  "If IV, WG or BG?" = c("BG", "--", "--", "--", "--")

-   Body satisfaction **increased** after large dancers and control (animal) videos
    -   But **decreased** after thin dancer videos
:::

## Study 2: Variables 

```{r}

  "Variable" = c("Dancer size", "Body satisfaction", "State appearance comparison", "Direction of appearance comparison scale", "Social Media Usage", "Trait appearance comparison (PACS)", "Thin internalization (SATAQ)", "Video Ratings"),
  "Levels?" = c("thin/lg/animal", "3-items", "3-items", "1-5, high better", "6-point, never - 3h", "11-items", "5-items", NA),
  "Manipulated or measured?" = c("Man", "Meas", "Meas", "Meas", "Meas", "Meas", "Meas", NA),
  "IV or DV or ??" = c("IV | BG | Yes |", "DV", "DV", "DV", "Control", "??", "??", "??"),
  "If IV, WG or BG?" = c(NA, "--", "--", "--", "--", "--", "--", NA),
  "**Study 1?**" = c(NA, "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "No", "No", "Yes")

## Study 2: Results?

![](images/mediation.png){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

::: notes
A majority of participants in the thin dancer condition engaged in upward comparison (comparing themselves negatively to the dancers), while a majority of participants in the large dancer condition engaged in downward comparison (comparing themselves positively to the dancers).
:::

## Study 3: Purpose?

::: callout-warning
-   Study 1 & 2:
    -   Ps aware study about body satisfaction...
    -   Used pretest-postest design...
-   Demand characteristics!!
    -   Internal or External validity issue?
:::

::: notes
One potential internal validity threat to both Study 1 and Study 2 is that participants were told the study was about body satisfaction. In addition, the pretest-postest nature of the design may have nudged participants to report changes in line with the study's goals.
:::

## Study 3: Used post-test-only design

::: callout-warning
Demand characteristics can be a threat to either INTERNAL or EXTERNAL VALIDITY!

-   Ps aware study about body satisfaction...may change behavior/answers!
-   Used pretest-postest design...testing effects!
:::

::: body
-   Why use a posttest-only design to control for these validity threats?

:::

## Study 3: Design


::: body
-   Recruited 375 women aged between 18 and 25 years and randomly assigned them to watch either TikTok videos of thin dancers or TikTok videos of large dancers.
-   Posttest-only design
-   Told ps study about how engaging different TikTok videos are

## Study 3: Task/Stimulus and Procedures

![](images/thin-thick.png){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

## Study 3: Results

![](images/study3_results.png){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

::: notes
After watching the videos, the participants completed the same measures of body satisfaction used in the previous studies.

Even after concealing the true purpose of the study, the results consistently indicated that watching videos of thin dancers led to lower body satisfaction compared to videos of large dancers.

# What do you think of this set of studies?

::: body
-   How does it do with four types of Validity?
    -   Internal Validity - how does it rule out threats?
-   External Validity 
    - samples/task/generalizability?
-   Measurement/Construct 
    - how does it measure the key concepts?
-   Statistical Conclusion 
    - replicate? effect sizes?

:::

::: notes
-   Specifically, when you address statistical validity, use terms like replication and effect size.

-   When you address internal validity, think about how the study rules out most internal validity threats.

-   When you address construct validity, ask a question about the measurement of the dependent variables.

-   When you address external validity, think about the samples used in these studies.

## Generalizing results? {.smaller}

Here's how the researchers concluded an interview about their studies:

::: {.info-box .small}
"The findings also [raise the possibility that TikTok could change its algorithm and show a wider variety of body types]{.highlight}, and this could have a major public health benefits. Body dissatisfaction is major risk factor for eating disorders and eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric diseases due to medical complications or suicide..."
