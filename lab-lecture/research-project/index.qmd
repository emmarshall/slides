## In-text Citations {.smaller}

::: inner-container
::: post-it
For someone's "...ideas, theories, or research..." <br> (APA publication manual, 2019, p. 281).
:::
:::

::: fragment
> Hindsight bias has been demonstrated in a variety of legal decision-making settings (Harley, 2007).

:::

::: fragment
Basic format for an In-text citation is *(author(s) name(s), publication year)*. When the source has *3 or more authors*, you should just cite the first author followed by *et. al*:

> Children with autism spectrum disorder are often very selective about what food they will eat and experience difficulties during mealtimes (Blank **et al.**, 2015).
:::

::: fragment
Finally, you can also cite someone by using them as the sentence subject:

> **Blank et al. (2015)** discussed how children with autism spectrum disorder are often very selective about what food they will eat and experience difficulties during mealtimes.
:::

## Multiple In-text citations & </br> Direct quotes {.smaller}

::: fragment
Sometimes, you need to cite multiple sources to back up one of your statements. If so, remember that the sources should be *ordered alphabetically* and separated by a "*;*":

> Studies demonstrate that hindsight bias can occur in various circumstances (**B**lank & Peters, 2010; **C**hristensen--Szalanski & Willham, 1991; **H**arley, 2007; **F**ischhoff, 1975, 1977).
:::

</br>

::: fragment
**Direct quotes** from other sources function very similar to in-text citations, but have a few differences; when the quote is *under 40 words*, the only addition necessary is enclosing the sentence within *quotations* and including the *page number*:

According to a recent paper, "quotes can be useful in academic writing" (Singh et al., 2019**, p. 25**).
:::

::: fragment
When the quote is *over 40 words*, you need to enclose the sentence within a [block-quote](https://www.scribbr.com/working-with-sources/block-quote/){target="_blank"}.

However, I don't think that this case should come up in your lab reports.

## References: Journal Article {.small}

At its end, every APA style manuscript should have a "references" section including the full references of all the sources cited in the main text. <u> The format of the reference changes depending on the source </u>(e.g., journal article, [book chapter](https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7/book-chapter){target="\"_blank"}, poster presentation, etc..).

By far, the most common type of sources are *journal articles*. The general format for journal article references is:

[Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C.]{.fragment fragment-index="1" style="color: red;"}[(Year of publication).]{.fragment fragment-index="2" style="color: blue;"}[Title of article.]{.fragment fragment-index="3" style="color: orange;"}[*Title of Journal*,]{.fragment fragment-index="4" style="color: magenta;"}[*volume number*]{.fragment fragment-index="5" style="color: grey;"}[(issue number),]{.fragment fragment-index="6" style="color: HotPink;"} [pages.]{.fragment fragment-index="7" style="color: purple;"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
> [Azen, R., & Budescu, D. V.]{.fragment fragment-index="1" style="color: red;"} [(2006).]{.fragment fragment-index="2" style="color: blue;"} [Comparing predictors in multivariate regression models: An extension of dominance analysis.]{.fragment fragment-index="3" style="color: orange;"} [*Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics*,]{.fragment fragment-index="4" style="color: magenta;"} [*31*]{.fragment fragment-index="5" style="color: grey;"}[(2),]{.fragment fragment-index="6" style="color: HotPink;"} [157--180.]{.fragment fragment-index="7" style="color: purple;"}
:::

<br /> <br />

::: {.fragment fragment-index="8"}
<p style="text-align: center;">

**There are many types of sources, so always make sure you are using the correct reference format given the source.**

</p>
:::

## Numbers {.smaller}

::: body
1.  Always spell out numbers when the number in question is not a statistic, below 10 OR is at the beginning of a line (e.g., "two" instead of "2"). Always use numerals for 10 or above.

2.  Round all numbers to **2 decimal places**. However, always round **p-values** to **3 decimal place**.

3.  Use a leading 0 only for numbers that can be larger than 1. For example, correlations and *p*-values can only range between -1/1 and 0/1 respectively, and do not need a leading 0 (e.g., "*r* = .57" instead of "*r* = 0.57")
:::

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations are usually employed for words that are repeated multiple times throughout a manuscript (e.g., "APA" in these slides).

</br>

::: fragment
The only rule to remember is to introduce the abbreviation the *1~st~ time the full word is presented*, and then *only* use the abbreviation for the rest of the paper:

> **Response time (RT)** was used as a measure of reaction speed. However, one has to keep in mind that pure **RT** may not fully capture the construct under investigation.
:::

::: fragment
Finally, Remember that using too many abbreviations may cause confusion.
