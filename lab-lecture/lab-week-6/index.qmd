## Advantages of Video-Based Software Instruction {.smaller}

***Clefton D. Slighter and A. Lindits DeLaroughe Sledver State College***

**Abstract:** The proliferation of CD-based instructional materials and their avowed success has led several researchers to undertake formal evaluation of the utility of this educational technology. In general, these evaluations have been quite positive. Users often report that the CD-based learning materials are more pleasant and engaging than traditional print materials. In addition, there is some evidence of better learning using the CDs. Our study sought to evaluate the utility of this educational technology for teaching computer-based statistical data analysis. Participants completed a short series of computational exercises guided either by a CD-based presentation or by printed materials. Results were generally consistent with previous findings, supporting the claims of the utility of this technology.

## Introduction {.smaller}

As computers, especially desktop computers, became more affordable and were adopted into business and educational settings, there was an immediate need to provide instruction to new users (Slighter, 1983). Previously this need had been met through printed instructional and procedural manuals. While these manuals were sufficient to provide information to computer specialists, it was discovered that they were not as useful for novice computer users (Clayton & Clayton, 1985). Most of the early efforts to improve the information provided to such novices was focused on improving the formatting (Slighter, 1983) and the clarity (Clayton & Clayton, 1985) of the instructional manuals. However, literature reviews by Slighter (1983) and Warkowe (1991) revealed little evidence that these efforts improved the functioning of the [printed]{.rn} materials.

With the advent of faster computers and better-suited programming languages, the potential for on-computer animated instructional materials was revealed (Tradford, 1988). Newer operating systems that allowed the user to view both the software being learned and the instructional materials on a single screen quickly made these sorts of on-computer instructional materials preferred to [video-tape]{.rn} instructional materials that had predominated until that time (Slighter, 1993).

## Method {.smaller}

### Participants

[Fifteen undergraduates]{.rn} from a large southern state university participated in each of the two training conditions. [Students taking "advanced statistics" courses in the Sociology, Psychology and Political Science departments were invited to participate]{.rn} in the project for a \$10.00 payment and course credit. The only [criterion for participation in the study was that participants must have previously had a statistics or research methods course in which they used SPSS to complete at least 5 data analysis assignments.]{.rn} Separate signup lists were provided to instructors of each class, each of which [requested the participation of five males and five females.]{.rn} APA guidelines for informed consent were followed.

## Materials {.smaller}

All participants, working individually, [used the academic version of SPSS 9.1 for Windows to complete a single data analysis exercise. The exercise involved entering and saving a 20-case data set including 5 variables, performing various transformations and computing univariate and correlational analyses, and obtaining a printout of the session activities.]{.rn} For [those in the instruction manual condition a single copy of the instruction manual provided by SPSS was made available on a desk at the front of the room. The manual includes all aspects of SPSS procedures; approximately 10 pages of which were directly pertinent to the assignment. Those in the instructional video condition were supplied with a copy of the instructional video prepared by the researchers and were given explicit instruction and a demonstration of the portion of the video they would be using. The video was running and visible on the same computer participants in the video condition used to complete their analyses. The full video requires about 45 minutes to complete, however the section pertinent to the assignment requires about 9 minutes to view.]{.rn}

## Materials {.smaller}

[A 20-item questionnaire was used to collect each participant's evaluation of the instructional material they used. These included 10 questions about the ease of use of the materials and 10 questions about the quality of information provided by the materials. Each question had three possible responses: 0) poor, 1) adequate and 2) good.]{.rn rn-color="red"}

## Procedure {.smaller}

All participants completed the procedure [in a single computer resource room]{.rn} during [one of 10 sessions that were conducted by one of the researchers or one of their four under-graduate research assistants.]{.rn} [Sessions included 2-6 participants]{.rn} each of whom was individually assigned to one of the instructional conditions. Participants were \]{.rn} [randomly assigned to instructional conditions with the single constraint that participants from the Psychology class were all assigned to the instructional manual condition because they had used the instructional CD while in the introductory psychology statistics course.]{.rn}

## Procedure {.smaller}

[Participants in the instruction manual condition were provided with a copy of the assignment, seated at a computer, and told they would have 20 minutes to complete the assignment and the location of the instructional manual. At the end of 20 minutes they were stopped, and their work saved to be analyzed later. Those in the instructional video condition were provided a copy of the assignment and seated at a computer. SPSS and the instructional video program were opened for them, and they were shown how to navigate between the two pieces of software and how to find the sections of the instructional video that detailed the procedural steps related to their assignment. These participants were encouraged to view the example of each activity required to complete a portion of the assignment, then stop the video and complete that part of the assignment. They were also shown how to replay portions of the video and how to have a video example running while working on SPSS. Before leaving the research session each participant completed the questionnaire.]{.rn}

## Results {.smaller}

Each participant's output file was reviewed, and [two scores were compiled. The accuracy of their final answers was measured on a % scale. The number of programming errors they made before getting their final answer was also recorded.]{.rn} Responses to the [questionnaires were aggregated to form two scores, ease of use and quality of information, each of which was scored on a 20-point scale.]{.rn} For these last [two measures, scores for the instruction manual condition were based on the six students in that condition who actually examined the instructional manual.]{.rn}

## Table {.smaller}

Table 1 summarizes the comparison of the instructional manual and video conditions. As can be seen the instructional video [led to]{.rn} [higher scores on each of the four measures, though the differences were only statistically significantly different for the ease of use rating, F(1, 19) = 4.22, p \< .05, Mse = 15.43, and the quality of information rating, F(1, 19) = 3.99, p \< .05, Mse = 21.23, and not for the accuracy of final answers, F(1,28) = .98, p \> .05, Mse = 4.12, nor for the number of programming errors, F(1,28) = 1.12, p \> .05, Mse = 4.42.]{.rn}

![](images/table_1.png){.r-stretch}

## Discussion {.smaller}

[Previous research has consistently demonstrated the tremendous advantage of video-based instruction for novice users.]{.rn} The purpose of this research was to further examine the utility of CD-based video instruction, specifically its utility for learning statistical software packages. This is an important topic of study because learning to navigate and apply these packages is often a source of challenge and difficulty to undergraduates studying behavioral science topics (Gliven, 1997).

The current findings support previous results about the utility of this type of instructional aid. [Here it was found that using the video instruction led to improvements in both the accuracy of the statistical results but also reduced the number of programming errors that were committed.]{.rn} In addition, the video instruction was clearly preferred by users to the instructional manuals.

## Discussion {.smaller}

Further research might be done to bolster evidence for the superiority of this instructional approach. However, it is our opinion that the combination of prior research showing its advantage for teaching office workers to function with word processing and spreadsheet programs and the [current research showing its advantage for improving the performance of novice data analysts]{.rn} would [provide ample evidence that video-based instruction can be expected to outperform instructional manuals in any context.]{.rn}

::: notes
Have you ever watched dance challenge videos on TikTok? If so, you probably noticed the skill and appearance of the dance model. Some psychologists have started to study how TikTok dance models affect viewers. A set of three studies asked, can the size of the dancer on TikTok influence the body satisfaction of a viewer? Journalists at PsyPost wrote up a summary of this empirical work. The research was originally published in the journal, Computers in Human Behavior; may be paywalled.

# What is the theory {.smaller}

-   The theory behind the study is related to the potential of social media to impact body esteem:

-   <div>

    > Media, especially its portrayal of the "thin ideal," where extremely slim bodies are considered attractive, has a significant impact on shaping these negative body perceptions.

    </div>

-   <div>

    > With the rise of social media platforms like TikTok, researchers are curious about how this new form of media might influence people's body image.

    </div>

## Study 1 {.smaller}

-   Researchers recruited 262 women aged between 18 and 25 years for an online experiment.
-   Ps randomly assigned to watch TikTok videos featuring:
    -   thin dancers
    -   large dancers
    -   videos of animals (control)
-   Both before and after watching the videos, participants rated:
    -   weight satisfaction
    -   overall appearance satisfaction
    -   body shape satisfaction

    2.  Used pretest-postest design...

-   Demand characteristics!!

    -   Internal or External validity issue?

::: notes
One potential internal validity threat to both Study 1 and Study 2 is that participants were told the study was about body satisfaction. In addition, the pretest-postest nature of the design may have nudged participants to report changes in line with the study's goals.
:::

## Study 3: Used post-test-only design

::: callout-warning
Demand characteristics can be a threat to either INTERNAL or EXTERNAL VALIDITY!

-   Ps aware study about body satisfaction...may change behavior/answers!
-   Used pretest-postest design...testing effects!
:::

-   Why use a posttest-only design to control for these validity threats?

## Study 3: Design

-   Recruited 375 women aged between 18 and 25 years and randomly assigned them to watch either TikTok videos of thin dancers or TikTok videos of large dancers.
-   Posttest-only design
-   Told ps study about how engaging different TikTok videos are

## Study 3: Task/Stimulus and Procedures

## Study 3: Results

![](images/study3_results.png){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

::: notes
After watching the videos, the participants completed the same measures of body satisfaction used in the previous studies.

Even after concealing the true purpose of the study, the results consistently indicated that watching videos of thin dancers led to lower body satisfaction compared to videos of large dancers.
:::

## What do you think of this set of studies?

-   How does it do with four types of Validity?
    -   Internal Validity - how does it rule out threats?
    -   External Validity - samples/task/generalizability?
    -   Measurement/Construct - how does it measure the key concepts?
    -   Statistical Conclusion - replicate? effect sizes?

::: notes
-   Specifically, when you address statistical validity, use terms like replication and effect size.

-   When you address internal validity, think about how the study rules out most internal validity threats.

-   When you address construct validity, ask a question about the measurement of the dependent variables.

-   When you address external validity, think about the samples used in these studies.
:::

## Beware the Conclusions!! {.smaller}

Here's how the researchers concluded an interview about their studies:

> I would like to add that this study shows that watching TikTok videos is not universally negative and that there are positive and negative effects...

> The findings also raise the possibility that TikTok could change its algorithm and show a wider variety of body types, and this could have a major public health benefits. Body dissatisfaction is major risk factor for eating disorders and eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric diseases due to medical complications or suicide.

## TRAAP Method

> How to evaluate sources but remember that context matters (assignement vs. paper vs. other?)

1.  Timeframe
2.  Relevance
3.  Authority
4.  Accuracy
5.  Purpose

::: notes
The TRAAP method is a way to help you critically think about your information and decide whether or not it is appropriate for your needs.
:::

## Avoiding the TRAAP of relying on bad sources

> How to evaluate sources but remember that context matters (assignement vs. paper vs. other?)

1.  Timeframe - *Is it too old to be useful?*
2.  Relevance - Does it give me the info I need right now?
3.  Authority - Who wrote it and why?
4.  Accuracy - Can claims be verified and how does it relate to other research?
5.  Purpose - Who is publishing this and why?

# How to Improve your Writing

Adapted from slides How to Improve Your Writing with many thanks to: James A. Burns University of Nebraska-Lincoln
:::

## Writing Skills Matter {.smaller}

-   College performance impacted by the quality of your writing.

-   But you can improve your writing by properly organizing and structuring your ideas.

-   There are a few myths about writing that should be dispelled before we begin:

    -   Great writers are born, not made by practicing.

    -   I need an IQ in the 130's in order to write well.

    -   I need to have the vocabulary of a rocket scientist in order to write good papers.

    -   My papers need to be over 30 pages in length in order to be acceptable.

    -   I will never be good at writing papers.

## Organization {.smaller}

1.  The most important (and often the most easily improved) aspects of writing are clarity and organization.

2.  The basic element of clarity and organization is a good paragraph.

3.  A good paragraph has 3 parts:

    1.  A TOPIC SENTENCE (to introduce the paragraph)

    2.  3-10 CONTENT SENTENCES

    3.  A TRANSITION SENTENCE (to introduce the next paragraph)

## Topic Sentences {.smaller}

-   The paragraph starts with what is called a "TOPIC SENTENCE".

-   Introduces topic of paragraph the idea you will be discussing in that paragraph.

-   ALL SENTENCES IN THE PARAGRAPH AFTER THE TOPIC SENTENCE MUST PERTAIN TO AND SUPPORT THE TOPIC SENTENCE!

    -   If there are sentences that do not pertain to the topic sentence, they are out of place (they probably belong in a different paragraph) and will only confuse the reader.

    -   There may be three to ten content sentences that support the topic sentence.

## Transitions {.smaller}

> After you have fully explained the topic sentence, you need a sentence to lead the reader into the next paragraph.

-   This type of sentence is called a TRANSITION SENTENCE.

-   Learning to write good transitions takes practice.

-   The transition often relates the idea from the current paragraph with what will be talked about next.

-   The transition is ALWAYS the last sentence of a paragraph.

::: callout-tip
It is much like a "clue" about what you will talk about next.
:::

## Here is an example {.smaller}

The paragraph talked about the psychological treatment of social phobia in adults.

The transition sentence at the end of the paragraph is:

> "Although much investigation has been done into the treatment of social phobia in adults, very little work has been done to address treatment avenues for children who suffer from the disorder."

-   Can you guess what the next paragraph will be about?

-   You got it, the next paragraph will be about the treatment of children with social phobia!

## Paragraphs {.smaller}

So, if we look at the format for any given paragraph, it should look like this.

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   TOPIC SENTENCE (new paragraph)

    -   content sentence #1

    -   content sentence #2

    -   content sentence #3

    -   . . .

    -   content sentence #8

-   TRANSITION SENTENCE
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   TOPIC SENTENCE (new paragraph)

    -   content sentence #1

    -   content sentence #2

    -   . . .

    -   content sentence #5

-   TRANSITION SENTENCE

-   ... and so on until the paper is finished!
:::
:::

## There is no limit on how long a paragraph should be {.smaller}

::: callout-warning
## But remember

-   If a paragraph is over 1 double-spaced page, it is probably too long. The reader may forget what idea the paragraph was discussing to begin with.

-   Remember that paragraphs that are too big, often are trying to say too much at one time.

-   Consider separating these multiple ideas and give each of them a separate paragraph, for a more complete description.

REMEMBER CLARITY IS THE ISSUE !

## Ordering Paragraphs {.smaller}

> OK, in what order do I put the paragraphs?

::: callout-tip
The "rule of thumb" is that you begin with the most general idea, then narrow the focus with each successive paragraph, and finally return to remind the reader of the general idea. Here's an example.

Paragraph #2  Describe the need for treating social phobia
Paragraph #3  Treatment of adults with social phobia
Paragraph #4  Treatment of children with social phobia
Paragraph #5  Inpatient versus outpatient treatment of social 
        phobia  for children
Paragraph #6  Proposed study will compare which is better (this
        paragraph will contain specific hypothesis about
        which treatment will be better.
Paragraph #7  A brief review of social phobia and what the
               proposed research will add to what we know.

Organized papers are easier to read because they provide a road map.
:::

## Improve your organization {.smaller}

-   Make and outline BEFORE you start writing

-   Label each idea (paragraph) and which order you believe they should appear in your paper.

-   It will also be useful to write your topic sentences and transitions\
    before you sit down to write the rest of the paper.

"The way to learn to write is to write. There are no short-cuts."

## Improve your organization

::: callout-tip
## Two things you should do after you finish your paper

-   Let the paper "get cold" for a day or two and re-read it (and probably re-write it - it never looks as good as you remember it being)

-   Let someone else read it -- "peer review" brings fresh ideas & options

## Concise Writing {.smaller}

-   Most reviews of articles involve reporting a variety of information, including number of participants, materials used, etc. (see grading sheets).

-   While it is acceptable to report each "bit" of information in its own sentence, this leads to a bloated paper that is boring to read.

-   Good writers learn to integrate ideas and information into concise sentences and paragraphs.

-   Think about each "bit" of information you are including. Are they truly separate "bits" or are they describing different aspects of the same idea? Can the bits be combined into more descriptive sentences?

## Examples {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Nonintegrated (Boring)

> Two hundred and four students participated in the study. All of the students were undergraduates in psychology. Roughly 84% of the participants were female. The materials used were the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. The participants were brought into a large classroom and asked to fill out the inventories.
