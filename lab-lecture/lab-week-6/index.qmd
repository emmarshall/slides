## Research Critique Assignments

> **Purpose:** Practice identifying and evaluating each of these important parts of a research report.

-   Step 1: Read (quickly-ish) the article
-   Step 2: Identify basics and big take-aways (main purpose, key design, etc.)
-   Step 3: Read (CAREFULLY) and take notes

## What to look for {.small}

[1]{.circle}  Hypotheses.

::: {.info-box .fragment .fade-up}
Look for all statements about the [research hypothesis.]{.highlight} - Remember can be explicit or implied - Common phrases like "lead to"
:::

[2]{.circle}  External validity components.

::: {.info-box .fragment .fade-up}
What looks good? What raises red flags? What is unclear? Relate [generalizability]{.highlight} back to stated goals of study.
:::

[3]{.circle}   Internal validity components.

::: {.info-box .fragment .fade-up}
What looks good? What raises red flags? What is unclear? Relate [confounds or causal interpretation]{.highlight} back to stated goals of study.
:::

## What to look for {.small}

[4]{.circle}  Anything else of interest you find!

::: {.info-box .fragment .fade-up}
-   Measurement/Construct validity - how did they [operationalize]{.highlight} key concepts?
-   Statistical Conclusion validity - can findings [replicate?]{.highlight} what about effect sizes?
:::

[5]{.circle}  Review your annotations and brainstorm alternatives.

::: {.info-box .fragment .fade-up}
Make suggestions or identify gaps in knowledge, **do not** always want to change the purpose, hypothesis, or overall design.

:::

::: notes
Have you ever watched dance challenge videos on TikTok? If so, you probably noticed the skill and appearance of the dance model. Some psychologists have started to study how TikTok dance models affect viewers. A set of three studies asked, can the size of the dancer on TikTok influence the body satisfaction of a viewer? Journalists at PsyPost wrote up a summary of this empirical work. The research was originally published in the journal, Computers in Human Behavior; may be paywalled.

## What is the theory

The theory behind the study is related to the potential of social media to impact body esteem:

::: {.info-box .small .fragmant .fragment-up}

1.  Media, especially its portrayal of the ["thin ideal,"]{.highlight} where extremely slim bodies are considered attractive, has a significant impact on shaping these negative body perceptions.

2.  With the rise of [social media platforms]{.highlight} like TikTok, researchers are curious about how this new form of media might influence people's body image.
:::

## Study 1 {.smaller}

-   Researchers recruited 262 women aged between 18 and 25 years for an online experiment.
-   Ps randomly assigned to watch TikTok videos featuring:
    -   thin dancers
    -   large dancers
    -   videos of animals (control)
-   Both before and after watching the videos, participants rated:
    -   weight satisfaction
    -   overall appearance satisfaction
    -   body shape satisfaction

## Study 2: Results?

![](images/mediation.png){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

::: notes
A majority of participants in the thin dancer condition engaged in upward comparison (comparing themselves negatively to the dancers), while a majority of participants in the large dancer condition engaged in downward comparison (comparing themselves positively to the dancers).
:::

## Study 3: Purpose?

-   Study 1 & 2:

    1.  Ps aware study about body satisfaction...

    2.  Used pretest-postest design...

-   Demand characteristics!!

    -   Internal or External validity issue?

::: notes
One potential internal validity threat to both Study 1 and Study 2 is that participants were told the study was about body satisfaction. In addition, the pretest-postest nature of the design may have nudged participants to report changes in line with the study's goals.
:::

## Study 3: Used post-test-only design

::: callout-warning
Demand characteristics can be a threat to either INTERNAL or EXTERNAL VALIDITY!

-   Ps aware study about body satisfaction...may change behavior/answers!
-   Used pretest-postest design...testing effects!
:::

-   Why use a posttest-only design to control for these validity threats?

## Study 3: Design

-   Recruited 375 women aged between 18 and 25 years and randomly assigned them to watch either TikTok videos of thin dancers or TikTok videos of large dancers.
-   Posttest-only design
-   Told ps study about how engaging different TikTok videos are

## Study 3: Task/Stimulus and Procedures

![](images/thin-thick.png){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

## Study 3: Results

![](images/study3_results.png){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

::: notes
After watching the videos, the participants completed the same measures of body satisfaction used in the previous studies.

Even after concealing the true purpose of the study, the results consistently indicated that watching videos of thin dancers led to lower body satisfaction compared to videos of large dancers.
:::

## What do you think of this set of studies?

-   How does it do with four types of Validity?
    -   Internal Validity - how does it rule out threats?
    -   External Validity - samples/task/generalizability?
    -   Measurement/Construct - how does it measure the key concepts?
    -   Statistical Conclusion - replicate? effect sizes?

::: notes
-   Specifically, when you address statistical validity, use terms like replication and effect size.

-   When you address internal validity, think about how the study rules out most internal validity threats.

-   When you address construct validity, ask a question about the measurement of the dependent variables.

-   When you address external validity, think about the samples used in these studies.
:::

## Generalizing results? {.smaller}

Here's how the researchers concluded an interview about their studies:

::: {.info-box .small}
"The findings also [raise the possibility that TikTok could change its algorithm and show a wider variety of body types]{.highlight}, and this could have a major public health benefits. Body dissatisfaction is major risk factor for eating disorders and eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric diseases due to medical complications or suicide..."

## TRAAP Method

> How to evaluate sources but remember that context matters (assignement vs. paper vs. other?)

1.  Timeframe
2.  Relevance
3.  Authority
4.  Accuracy
5.  Purpose

::: notes
The TRAAP method is a way to help you critically think about your information and decide whether or not it is appropriate for your needs.
:::

## Avoiding the TRAAP of relying on bad sources

> How to evaluate sources but remember that context matters (assignement vs. paper vs. other?)

1.  Timeframe - *Is it too old to be useful?*
2.  Relevance - Does it give me the info I need right now?
3.  Authority - Who wrote it and why?
4.  Accuracy - Can claims be verified and how does it relate to other research?
5.  Purpose - Who is publishing this and why?

# How to Improve your Writing

::: footer
Adapted from slides How to Improve Your Writing with many thanks to: James A. Burns University of Nebraska-Lincoln
:::

## Writing Skills Matter {.smaller}

-   College performance impacted by the quality of your writing.

-   But you can improve your writing by properly organizing and structuring your ideas.

-   There are a few myths about writing that should be dispelled before we begin:

    -   Great writers are born, not made by practicing.

    -   I need an IQ in the 130's in order to write well.

    -   I need to have the vocabulary of a rocket scientist in order to write good papers.

    -   My papers need to be over 30 pages in length in order to be acceptable.

    -   I will never be good at writing papers.

## Organization {.smaller}

1.  The most important (and often the most easily improved) aspects of writing are clarity and organization.

2.  The basic element of clarity and organization is a good paragraph.

3.  A good paragraph has 3 parts:

    1.  A TOPIC SENTENCE (to introduce the paragraph)

    2.  3-10 CONTENT SENTENCES

    3.  A TRANSITION SENTENCE (to introduce the next paragraph)

## Topic Sentences {.smaller}

-   The paragraph starts with what is called a "TOPIC SENTENCE".

-   Introduces topic of paragraph the idea you will be discussing in that paragraph.

-   ALL SENTENCES IN THE PARAGRAPH AFTER THE TOPIC SENTENCE MUST PERTAIN TO AND SUPPORT THE TOPIC SENTENCE!

    -   If there are sentences that do not pertain to the topic sentence, they are out of place (they probably belong in a different paragraph) and will only confuse the reader.

    -   There may be three to ten content sentences that support the topic sentence.

## Transitions {.smaller}

> After you have fully explained the topic sentence, you need a sentence to lead the reader into the next paragraph.

-   This type of sentence is called a TRANSITION SENTENCE.

-   Learning to write good transitions takes practice.

-   The transition often relates the idea from the current paragraph with what will be talked about next.

-   The transition is ALWAYS the last sentence of a paragraph.

::: callout-tip
It is much like a "clue" about what you will talk about next.
:::

## Here is an example {.smaller}

The paragraph talked about the psychological treatment of social phobia in adults.

The transition sentence at the end of the paragraph is:

> "Although much investigation has been done into the treatment of social phobia in adults, very little work has been done to address treatment avenues for children who suffer from the disorder."

-   Can you guess what the next paragraph will be about?

-   You got it, the next paragraph will be about the treatment of children with social phobia!

## Paragraphs {.smaller}

So, if we look at the format for any given paragraph, it should look like this.

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   TOPIC SENTENCE (new paragraph)

    -   content sentence #1

    -   content sentence #2

    -   content sentence #3

    -   . . .

    -   content sentence #8

-   TRANSITION SENTENCE
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   TOPIC SENTENCE (new paragraph)

    -   content sentence #1

    -   content sentence #2

    -   . . .

    -   content sentence #5

-   TRANSITION SENTENCE

-   ... and so on until the paper is finished!

## There is no limit on how long a paragraph should be {.smaller}

::: callout-warning
## But remember

-   If a paragraph is over 1 double-spaced page, it is probably too long. The reader may forget what idea the paragraph was discussing to begin with.

-   Remember that paragraphs that are too big, often are trying to say too much at one time.

-   Consider separating these multiple ideas and give each of them a separate paragraph, for a more complete description.

REMEMBER CLARITY IS THE ISSUE !

## Ordering Paragraphs {.smaller}

> OK, in what order do I put the paragraphs?

::: callout-tip
The "rule of thumb" is that you begin with the most general idea, then narrow the focus with each successive paragraph, and finally return to remind the reader of the general idea. Here's an example.

Organized papers are easier to read because they provide a road map.

## Improve your organization {.smaller}

-   Make and outline BEFORE you start writing

-   Label each idea (paragraph) and which order you believe they should appear in your paper.

-   It will also be useful to write your topic sentences and transitions\
    before you sit down to write the rest of the paper.

## Improve your organization

::: callout-tip
## Two things you should do after you finish your paper

-   Let the paper "get cold" for a day or two and re-read it (and probably re-write it - it never looks as good as you remember it being)

-   Let someone else read it -- "peer review" brings fresh ideas & options

## Concise Writing {.smaller}

-   Most reviews of articles involve reporting a variety of information, including number of participants, materials used, etc. (see grading sheets).

-   While it is acceptable to report each "bit" of information in its own sentence, this leads to a bloated paper that is boring to read.

-   Good writers learn to integrate ideas and information into concise sentences and paragraphs.

-   Think about each "bit" of information you are including. Are they truly separate "bits" or are they describing different aspects of the same idea? Can the bits be combined into more descriptive sentences?

## Examples {.smaller}

### Nonintegrated (Boring)

> Two hundred and four students participated in the study. All of the students were undergraduates in psychology. Roughly 84% of the participants were female. The materials used were the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. The participants were brought into a large classroom and asked to fill out the inventories.
