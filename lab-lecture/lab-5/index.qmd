## Today's Tasks {background-image="images/fitz.png" background-opacity="0.1"}

::: v-center-container
::: post-it
-   Today's lab:
    -   Reading & writing research reports
    -   Review Lecture Material
        -   Contents of a research report, Validity Net, All the words
:::
:::

::: notes
Today is about learning to dig into a paper and read it critically. This means extracting information -- especially extracting information that isn't directly given to you in a paper and must be inferred. But, we will also learn when not to make assumptions that cover up potential flaws

## Reading & Writing: Research Reports {.small}

<center>

::: callout-tip
Everything we do revolves around these **6** basic things!!
:::

</center>

::: vspace
:::

::: body
1.  What has the author(s) read that **prompted** the research?
2.  What is the **purpose** of the research being reported ?
3.  What is the specific **research question** or **research hypothesis**?
4.  How was the research **conducted** ?
5.  What are the **results** of the statistical analysis of the data as they relate to the research question or research hypothesis?
6.  How do the current findings **integrate** with what the author(s) read that prompted the research?

## Standardizing Research with APA {.tiny}

::: body
-   APA standardized style & formatting for journals (1928-present)
    -   Currently on [APA 7th Ed.](https://apastyle.apa.org/)
-   Three main components to style-guide:
    1.  **Content** of the report
        -   **Order** of concepts & material
        -   Rules for **sections** & **labels**
    2.  **Format** of the report
        -   margins, citations, tables, etc.
    3.  **Style** of the report
        -   language & terminology
:::
:::
:::

::: notes
Since there is a nearly universal set of 6 things used to describe one's research and its outcomes, it makes sense to "standardize" those reports -- making it easier to write them clearly and easier to read them.

Such "standardization" was the intent of a group of editors and business managers of anthropological and psychological journals in 1928. They wrote 7-page set of guidelines for authors. The most recent version of these guidelines, the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 4th Ed., is a bit larger (368 pages), but has the same basic intent.

APA format, as we will apply it, has three components:\
1) the content of the report and how it is organized and labeled 2) the format of the report (e.g., margins, citations, tables, etc.) 3) the style of the report (e.g., non-sexist language)
:::

## Elements of APA Style

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Basic Rules:

-   Double-space everything
-   Have uniform margins of at least 1 in. at the top, bottom, right, and left of every page
-   Write "formally" -- without slang, contractions, etc.
-   Use sentences and paragraphs (not "lists" unless hypotheses)
-   Give credit to others for their ideas

## Research Critiques: What to look for {.tiny}

::: body
-   ***Hypotheses:***
    -   Look for all statements about the research hypothesis.
    -   Remember can be **explicit** or **implied**
-   ***External validity components***
    -   What looks **good**? What raises **red flags**? What is **unclear**?
    -   Relate [**generalizability**]{.rn} back to stated **goals** of study (**pop of interest**)
-   ***Internal validity components***
    -   What looks **good**? What raises red flags? What is unclear?
    -   Relate [**confounds** or **causal** interpretation]{.rn} back to stated goals of study (**design/hypotheses**).
-   ***Anything else*** of interest you find!
-   ***Review*** your annotations and ***brainstorm*** alternatives.
    -   Make suggestions or identify gaps in knowledge, **do not** change the purpose, hypothesis, or overall design!

::: callout-warning
## Remember!!

Your job is to understand/critique the methods & procedures they ***actually*** used, not the ideal study in your head!
