::: notes
Today is about learning to dig into a paper and read it critically. This means extracting information -- especially extracting information that isn't directly given to you in a paper and must be inferred. But, we will also learn when not to make assumptions that cover up potential flaws

## Experimental Design: The Basics

In general, an **experiment** is a procedure that researchers use to assess the effect of one variable (IV) on another variable (DV).

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
::: col
</br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
<p style="font-size: 24px;">

**Independent variable (IV):** In experiments, this is the variable that the researchers manipulate (e.g., randomly assigning participants to 2 different groups).

</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">

*synonyms*: Predictor variable, Explanatory variable.

</p>
:::

</br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
<p style="font-size: 24px;">

**Dependent variable (DV):** In experiments, this is the variable of interest. This variable is expected to change according to the IV.

</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">

*synonyms*: Outcome variable, Response variable.

</p>

::: {.fragment fragment-index="3"}
<p style="font-size: 24px;">

**Control group or control condition:** Baseline group. All other experimental groups are usually compared to this group.

</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">

*synonyms*: Comparison group, Placebo condition.

</p>

</br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index="4"}
<p style="font-size: 24px;">

**Variable types:**

</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">

*Continuous variables*: Essentially numbers (e.g., 5.4).

</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">

*Discrete variables*: Gender, experimental condition (e.g., control VS treatment), Hair color, etc...

</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">

*Ordinal variables*: Olympic medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze)

## Reading & Writing <br> Research Reports {.smaller}

::: callout-note
## Everything we do revolves around these 6 basic things
:::

::: body
1.  What has the author(s) read that prompted the research?
2.  What is the purpose of the research being reported ?
3.  What is the specific research question or research hypothesis ?
4.  How was the research conducted ?
    -   who were the participants?
    -   what equipment and/or materials were used?
    -   what treatment & data collection procedures were used ?
5.  What are the results of the statistical analysis of the data as they relate to the research question or research hypothesis?
6.  How do the current findings integrate with what the author(s) read that prompted the research?

## Standardizing Research: <br> Enter APA

::: callout-note
## Everything we do revolves around these 6 basic things
:::
::: body
-   APA standardized style and formatting for journals (1928-present)
-   Currently on [APA 7th Ed.](https://apastyle.apa.org/)
-   Three main components to style-guide:
    1.  **Content** of the report

    -   how it is organized
    -   sections and labels

    2.  **Format** of the report

    -   margins, citations, tables, etc.

    3.  **Style** of the report

    -   language and terminology

:::
::: notes
Since there is a nearly universal set of 6 things used to describe one's research and its outcomes, it makes sense to "standardize" those reports -- making it easier to write them clearly and easier to read them.

Such "standardization" was the intent of a group of editors and business managers of anthropological and psychological journals in 1928. They wrote 7-page set of guidelines for authors. The most recent version of these guidelines, the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 4th Ed., is a bit larger (368 pages), but has the same basic intent.

APA format, as we will apply it, has three components:\
1) the content of the report and how it is organized and labeled 2) the format of the report (e.g., margins, citations, tables, etc.) 3) the style of the report (e.g., non-sexist language)

- **Background about the topic:** What is the topic of the article? What research has been done on it? 
:::

:::{.fragment}
- **Gaps in the literature:** What research is missing? What questions *has not* been explored? 
:::

:::{.fragment}
- **The current study:** <strong> Why </strong> is the current study being done? What are the variables involved (IV and DV)? What are the hypotheses (if any)?
:::

## Method


[<a href="#/presentation-grading-rubric"><i class="fa fa-home fa-sm" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#6971E0; position:absolute;"></i></a>]{.absolute top="99%" left="5%"}

Usually, the method section is divided into the following subsections: 


:::{.fragment}
- **Participants:** What is the demographic composition of the sample? How many participants are there?
:::

:::{.fragment}
- **Materials:** How were the variables measured? What are the values of the measured variable (e.g., "the possible values of the IV ranged from 0 to 100")?

- **Procedure:** What was the experimental design? How did the experiment take place?

<center>  This is the part where you present the statistics (ðŸ˜’) </center>


<ul style ="font-size:28px; padding-top: 1em;">
:::{.fragment}
<li>  Remember that this is supposed to be a short presentation, so you should only report the most important statistics (i.e., the ones directly related to the main hypotheses). </li> 
:::

:::{.fragment}
<li>  <u> Make use of figures (e.g., bar charts) as much as possible </u>. This always makes it so much easier to understand the results. Tables can also help. </li> 
:::

:::{.fragment}
<li>  Explain what the statistics mean in *plain English*, do not just say "*this results was significant*". Rather, say something like "*so, this statistic tells use that group A had significantly better recall than group B*." </li>

The discussion is usually where the researchers briefly summarize the results and provide personal opinions about the study. The important points to identify are:


<ul style = "font-size: 35px">

:::{.fragment}
<li> **Results Summary:** Briefly recap the main findings. </li>
:::

:::{.fragment}
<li> **Interpretation and Implications:** Were the main hypotheses supported? Why were certain results observed? 
What are the practical implications of the results? </li>

<li> **Limitations:** What are some possible issues with the study? </li>
:::

<li> **Future directions:** What research should be done next?  </li>

## Elements of APA Style

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Basic Rules:
-   Double-space everything
-   Have uniform margins of at least 1 in. at the top, bottom, right, and left of every page
-   Write "formally" -- without slang, contractions, etc.
-   Use sentences and paragraphs (not "lists" unless hypotheses)
-   Give credit to others for their ideas

## Validity Net {.scrollable}

![](images/validity.png){.r-stretch}

::: notes
This is copied over from the lecture section, week 3. Go through this as a refresher of what kinds of validity there are, and what these mean for interpretation of a study.
:::

## All the Words {.scrollable}

![](images/words.png){.r-stretch}

::: notes
This is also copied from week 3 of the lecture section. This one is more of a checklist of things to extract from the study as you read it. These are the questions they should be trying to answer, but it doesn't end there... they still need to consider the consequences of each item/researcher choice. These last 2 handouts will be important to refer to as they read.

## Research Critique Assignments

[EXTRA CREDIT: Research Critique 1](https://uofnelincoln-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/mwilliamson3_unl_edu/EdxkpxmY9yVHha22CLXvr0sBWz_H2V8h14sj9Yo_fj3-DA)

> **Purpose:** Practice identifying and evaluating each of these important parts of a research report.

-   Step 1: Read (quickly-ish) the article
-   Step 2: Identify basics and big take-aways (main purpose, key design, etc.)
-   Step 3: Read (CAREFULLY) and take notes

# Step 1: What is the research hypothesis. {background-image="images/fitz.png" background-opacity="0.1"}


## Research Critique 1: What to look for {.smaller}

1.  Hypotheses.

    | [Look for all statements about the research hypothesis.]{.rn} Remember can be explicit or implied.

2.  External validity components.

    | What looks good? What raises red flags? What is unclear? Relate [generalizability]{.rn} back to stated goals of study.

3.  Internal validity components.

    | What looks good? What raises red flags? What is unclear? Relate [confounds or causal interpretation]{.rn} back to stated goals of study.

4.  Anything else of interest you find!

5.  Review your annotations and brainstorm alternatives.

    | Make suggestions or identify gaps in knowledge, **do not** change the purpose, hypothesis, or overall design.

## Remember!!

Your job is to critique the methods & procedures they used, not to design a whole new study!
