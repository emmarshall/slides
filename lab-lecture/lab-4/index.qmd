I am definitely not telling you to use an alternative open-source site like [Sci-hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) because I would never tell you to do that because IP & copyright law is super-duper moral and uncomplicated.

## Bibliographic Assignment {.smaller}


::: {.body .nonincremental}
-   Step 1: Locate variables of interest (i.e., Lab 1&2 question 5 or pick new ones)
-   Step 2: Find [(classic)]{.rn} articles!
-   Step 3: Find [MORE (recent)]{.rn} articles!
-   Step 4: Identify the larger context in which variables are studied to create [search terms]{.rn}
-   Step 5: Search them terms!
-   Step 6: Find [EVEN MORE (authors)]{.rn} references!
-   Step 7: Organize and construct references section in APA format using ZOTERO

::: callout-note
The goal is to build a section of your final project--taking your time to do this correctly now will save you hours and energy in the future!

## Practice Finding References {.scrollable}

::: inner-container
::: post-it
-   **Step 1: Identify `concept` or `construct` of interest**
    -   Hindsight Bias (construct itself not specific scales or variables!)
-   **Step 2: Find (classic) articles**
    -   GO to [APA PsychInfo](https://unl.libguides.com/az.php?s=14107)!!!
-   **Step 3: Find MORE (recent) articles!**
    -   ...within last five years so PsychInfo or Google Scholar

-   **Step 4:** Identify the larger context to create search terms

    -   ...hindsight bias is a cognitive bias and relates to how people make sense of events

-   

    ## **Step 5: Search them terms!**

-   **Step 6: Find EVEN MORE (authors) references!**

    -   ...reference section of newer articles is a great place to look

-   Step 7: Organize and construct references section in APA format using ZOTERO

    -   ...always double-check meta-data is accurate and includes APA components
