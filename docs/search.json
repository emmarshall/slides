Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you’ll count the number of cats.\nDiscrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.\nExamples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country."

Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\nWhen you see decimal places for individual values, you’re looking at a continuous variable.\nExamples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature."
