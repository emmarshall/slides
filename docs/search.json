These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5!

Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\nWhen you see decimal places for individual values, you’re looking at a continuous variable.\nExamples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature."

When a judge resigns, retires, dies, or is removed from office, the vacant position falls under the discretion of a judicial nominating commission.\nEach judicial nominating commission is made up of four lawyers selected by the Nebraska State Bar Association, four nonlawyers who are appointed by the Governor, and a nonvoting Supreme Court justice acting as chairperson. The judicial nominating commission must not have more than two lawyers or two nonlawyer members from either political party. A judicial nominating commission holds a public hearing to interview candidates who have submitted their names for the open position. The judicial nominating commission submits the names of at least two qualified attorneys to the Governor. Generally, the Governor decides who will become the new judge. However, if the Governor elects not to make an appointment within 60 days after receiving the list of nominees from the judicial nominating commission, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court makes the appointment from the list of nominees.\nQualifications of Judges Applicants for positions on all levels of Nebraska courts must meet a number of requirements in order to be appointed to office. Each person must be a U.S. citizen, be at least 30 years of age, and have practiced law a minimum of 5 years in the State of Nebraska. The person must also be currently admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court.\nThe Judicial Nominating Commissioner’s Manual contains detailed information on the merit selection system.\nRetention of Judges A judge must run for retention in office in the first general election that occurs more than 3 years after their appointment, and every 6 years thereafter.\nWhen a judge runs for retention in office, the question presented on the voters’ ballots states: “Shall Judge [blank] be retained in office?” If more than 50 percent of the voters indicate that the judge should not be retained, the judge is removed."

    "text": "And also…\n\nStudies have found evidence that lawyer judges can…\n\n\nFail to ignore inadmissible evidence1\nInaccurately evaluate:\n\nscientific, expert, or statistical evidence2\n\nExhibit some lay cognitive biases and heuristics:3\n\nanchoring & framing effects\nhindsight bias\nconfirmation bias\negocentric bias\n\n\n\nWhat can we make of these findings? One interpretation is that despite their legal training, judges are no different than laypersons in being prone to cognitive biases. On the other hand, the lack of real-world context in simulation experiments may artificially inflate the effects of biases. In actual trials, judges weigh inadmissible evidence along with many other pieces of evidence, including arguments by opposing legal counsel, so any effects of implicit biases may be negligible.\nThe Rachlinski et al. (2009) study also hints that when judges have more detailed information or deal with settled legal doctrines, such as those bearing search and seizure, and have more time to consider and deliberate, their training allows them to process information differently than laypersons. Yet, research on actual sentencing decisions in which race is implicated gives us reason to pause.\n\nLandsman & Rakos, 1994; Wistrich et al., 2005Kovera & McAuliff, 2000; Groscup, 2004Guthrie et al., 2001"

They also now spend much of their time managing the pretrial and case settlement processes as well as overseeing the implementation of remedies posttrial (Resnik, 1982).\nAs fact-finders, judges may struggle to simultaneously accomplish myriad goals.\nAppellate judges face an overlapping and different set of tasks than trial court judges. They do not act as fact-finders and instead are primarily engaged in the process of judicial review.\nThey face decisions such as whether to grant cert to hear a case or whether to grant en banc review.\nThey also make decisions about whether to ask questions at oral argument and what the nature of those questions will be.\nThey also engage in more opinion writing and, in additional to determining how they will vote in a particular case, must decide whether to join a particular opinion, to write separately, or to author a dissenting opinion.\nThe specific appellate court a judge sits on also impacts the decisions they make. For example, SCOTUS justices exercise more control over their agenda than intermediate appellate judges."

    "text": "Models of Judicial Decision Making\n\nTraditional legal theory says judges reach decisions based on law and precedent.\n\n\nBut judges are people too!\n\nwith varied qualifications and constraints\n\nNo single model explains judges behavior\n\nBut can incorporate:\n\nExpertise…\nTraining…\nAttitudes…\nMotivations & goals…\nCognitions…\nSocial context…\n& more!\n\n\n\n\nEach of the varied decisions that judges are called on to make inevitably evokes a range of possible goals. Different models of judicial decision making tend to highlight particular goals.\nThere are various legal realist and critical realist alternatives to this model including attitudinal, strategic and managerial models.\nThe attitudinal models focus on the ways in which judges make decisions that further their preferred policy objectives (Segal & Spaeth, 1993, 2002).\nStrategic models incorporate considerations of the ways that judges seek to effectuate their goals in the long term (Epstein & Knight, 1998; Maltzman, Spriggs, & Wahlbeck, 2000)\nThe best way to think about these models is they each may accurately capture some of what ever judge does some of the time and no single model is likely to describe any judge all the time. A sophisticated understanding of judicial decision making should explicitly incorporate the notion that judges simultaneously attempt to further numerous, disparate, and often conflicting, objectives."
