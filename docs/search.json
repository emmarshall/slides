Governor-controlled commission: The governor is responsible for appointing a majority of the judicial nominating commission that sends the governor a list of nominees they must choose from.

When a judge resigns, retires, dies, or is removed from office, the vacant position falls under the discretion of a judicial nominating commission.\nEach judicial nominating commission is made up of four lawyers selected by the Nebraska State Bar Association, four nonlawyers who are appointed by the Governor, and a nonvoting Supreme Court justice acting as chairperson. The judicial nominating commission must not have more than two lawyers or two nonlawyer members from either political party. A judicial nominating commission holds a public hearing to interview candidates who have submitted their names for the open position. The judicial nominating commission submits the names of at least two qualified attorneys to the Governor. Generally, the Governor decides who will become the new judge. However, if the Governor elects not to make an appointment within 60 days after receiving the list of nominees from the judicial nominating commission, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court makes the appointment from the list of nominees.\nQualifications of Judges Applicants for positions on all levels of Nebraska courts must meet a number of requirements in order to be appointed to office. Each person must be a U.S. citizen, be at least 30 years of age, and have practiced law a minimum of 5 years in the State of Nebraska. The person must also be currently admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court.\nThe Judicial Nominating Commissioner’s Manual contains detailed information on the merit selection system.\nRetention of Judges A judge must run for retention in office in the first general election that occurs more than 3 years after their appointment, and every 6 years thereafter.\nWhen a judge runs for retention in office, the question presented on the voters’ ballots states: “Shall Judge [blank] be retained in office?” If more than 50 percent of the voters indicate that the judge should not be retained, the judge is removed."

One interpretation is that despite their legal training, judges are no different than laypersons in being prone to cognitive biases. On the other hand, the lack of real-world context in simulation experiments may artificially inflate the effects of biases. In actual trials, judges weigh inadmissible evidence along with many other pieces of evidence, including arguments by opposing legal counsel, so any effects of implicit biases may be negligible.\nThe Rachlinski et al. (2009) study also hints that when judges have more detailed information or deal with settled legal doctrines, such as those bearing search and seizure, and have more time to consider and deliberate, their training allows them to process information differently than laypersons. Yet, research on actual sentencing decisions in which race is implicated gives us reason to pause.\n\nLandsman & Rakos, 1994; Wistrich et al., 2005Kovera & McAuliff, 2000; Groscup, 2004Guthrie et al., 2001"

They do not act as fact-finders and instead are primarily engaged in the process of judicial review.\nThey face decisions such as whether to grant cert to hear a case or whether to grant en banc review.\nThey also make decisions about whether to ask questions at oral argument and what the nature of those questions will be.\nThey also engage in more opinion writing and, in additional to determining how they will vote in a particular case, must decide whether to join a particular opinion, to write separately, or to author a dissenting opinion.\nThe specific appellate court a judge sits on also impacts the decisions they make. For example, SCOTUS justices exercise more control over their agenda than intermediate appellate judges."

Different models of judicial decision making tend to highlight particular goals.\nThere are various legal realist and critical realist alternatives to this model including attitudinal, strategic and managerial models.\nThe attitudinal models focus on the ways in which judges make decisions that further their preferred policy objectives (Segal & Spaeth, 1993, 2002).\nStrategic models incorporate considerations of the ways that judges seek to effectuate their goals in the long term (Epstein & Knight, 1998; Maltzman, Spriggs, & Wahlbeck, 2000)\nThe best way to think about these models is they each may accurately capture some of what ever judge does some of the time and no single model is likely to describe any judge all the time. A sophisticated understanding of judicial decision making should explicitly incorporate the notion that judges simultaneously attempt to further numerous, disparate, and often conflicting, objectives."

Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you’ll count the number of cats.\nDiscrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.\nExamples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country."

They wrote 7-page set of guidelines for authors.

    "text": "Advantages of Video-Based Software Instruction\nClefton D. Slighter and A. Lindits DeLaroughe Sledver State College\nAbstract: The proliferation of CD-based instructional materials and their avowed success has led several researchers to undertake formal evaluation of the utility of this educational technology. In general, these evaluations have been quite positive. Users often report that the CD-based learning materials are more pleasant and engaging than traditional print materials. In addition, there is some evidence of better learning using the CDs. Our study sought to evaluate the utility of this educational technology for teaching computer-based statistical data analysis. Participants completed a short series of computational exercises guided either by a CD-based presentation or by printed materials. Results were generally consistent with previous findings, supporting the claims of the utility of this technology.\nAs computers, especially desktop computers, became more affordable and were adopted into business and educational settings, there was an immediate need to provide instruction to new users (Slighter, 1983). Previously this need had been met through printed instructional and procedural manuals. While these manuals were sufficient to provide information to computer specialists, it was discovered that they were not as useful for novice computer users (Clayton & Clayton, 1985). Most of the early efforts to improve the information provided to such novices was focused on improving the formatting (Slighter, 1983) and the clarity (Clayton & Clayton, 1985) of the instructional manuals. However, literature reviews by Slighter (1983) and Warkowe (1991) revealed little evidence that these efforts improved the functioning of the printed materials.\nWith the advent of faster computers and better-suited programming languages, the potential for on-computer animated instructional materials was revealed (Tradford, 1988). Newer operating systems that allowed the user to view both the software being learned and the instructional materials on a single screen quickly made these sorts of on-computer instructional materials preferred to video-tape instructional materials that had predominated until that time (Slighter, 1993).\nMany of the early and successful video instructional programs were designed to help novice computer users to become familiar and functional with word processing and spreadsheet programs. Experimental evaluations of these products were common, though of varied quality. The most common procedure was to compare the skills and accuracy acquired from reading the manual with those acquired from viewing a video-based presentation of the material. The results were mixed, but the majority of studies demonstrated that the novice users preferred using the video materials to using the manuals, although there was less evidence that users learned more from the video materials (Warkowe, 1991).\nWhile there have been numerous comparisons of video and written instructional materials for word processing and spreadsheet software, there has been no careful comparisons made with respect to data analysis software. Similarly, while there has been substantial study of the preferences for, and differential functioning of, these types of instructional materials for adult office-workers who are learning new software, there has been no research that allows us to speak conclusively to which type of materials will work best for college and university students who are learning to use a new software product. The purpose of this study was to provide a first examination of this type. Based on the literature cited above, we expected to find that the instructional video materials would be preferred to the print materials and would also lead to greater performance proficiency.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFifteen undergraduates from a large southern state university participated in each of the two training conditions. Students taking “advanced statistics” courses in the Sociology, Psychology and Political Science departments were invited to participate in the project for a $10.00 payment and course credit. The only criterion for participation in the study was that participants must have previously had a statistics or research methods course in which they used SPSS to complete at least 5 data analysis assignments. Separate signup lists were provided to instructors of each class, each of which requested the participation of five males and five females. APA guidelines for informed consent were followed.\nMaterials\nAll participants, working individually, used the academic version of SPSS 9.1 for Windows to complete a single data analysis exercise. The exercise involved entering and saving a 20-case data set including 5 variables, performing various transformations and computing univariate and correlational analyses, and obtaining a printout of the session activities. For those in the instruction manual condition a single copy of the instruction manual provided by SPSS was made available on a desk at the front of the room. The manual includes all aspects of SPSS procedures; approximately 10 pages of which were directly pertinent to the assignment. Those in the instructional video condition were supplied with a copy of the instructional video prepared by the researchers and were given explicit instruction and a demonstration of the portion of the video they would be using. The video was running and visible on the same computer participants in the video condition used to complete their analyses. The full video requires about 45 minutes to complete, however the section pertinent to the assignment requires about 9 minutes to view.\nA 20-item questionnaire was used to collect each participant’s evaluation of the instructional material they used. These included 10 questions about the ease of use of the materials and 10 questions about the quality of information provided by the materials. Each question had three possible responses: 0) poor, 1) adequate and 2) good.\nProcedure\nAll participants completed the procedure in a single computer resource room during one of 10 sessions that were conducted by one of the researchers or one of their four under-graduate research assistants. Sessions included 2-6 participants each of whom was individually assigned to one of the instructional conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to instructional conditions with the single constraint that participants from the Psychology class were all assigned to the instructional manual condition because they had used the instructional CD while in the introductory psychology statistics course.\nParticipants in the instruction manual condition were provided with a copy of the assignment, seated at a computer, and told they would have 20 minutes to complete the assignment and the location of the instructional manual. At the end of 20 minutes they were stopped, and their work saved to be analyzed later. Those in the instructional video condition were provided a copy of the assignment and seated at a computer. SPSS and the instructional video program were opened for them, and they were shown how to navigate between the two pieces of software and how to find the sections of the instructional video that detailed the procedural steps related to their assignment. These participants were encouraged to view the example of each activity required to complete a portion of the assignment, then stop the video and complete that part of the assignment. They were also shown how to replay portions of the video and how to have a video example running while working on SPSS. Before leaving the research session each participant completed the questionnaire.\nResults\nEach participant’s output file was reviewed, and two scores were compiled. The accuracy of their final answers was measured on a % scale. The number of programming errors they made before getting their final answer was also recorded. Responses to the questionnaires were aggregated to form two scores, ease of use and quality of information, each of which was scored on a 20-point scale. For these last two measures, scores for the instruction manual condition were based on the six students in that condition who actually examined the instructional manual.\nTable 1 summarizes the comparison of the instructional manual and video conditions. As can be seen the instructional video led to higher scores on each of the four measures, though the differences were only statistically significantly different for the ease of use rating, F(1, 19) = 4.22, p &lt; .05, Mse = 15.43, and the quality of information rating, F(1, 19) = 3.99, p &lt; .05, Mse = 21.23, and not for the accuracy of final answers, F(1,28) = .98, p &gt; .05, Mse = 4.12, nor for the number of programming errors, F(1,28) = 1.12, p &gt; .05, Mse = 4.42.\n\nDiscussion\nPrevious research has consistently demonstrated the tremendous advantage of video-based instruction for novice users. The purpose of this research was to further examine the utility of CD-based video instruction, specifically its utility for learning statistical software packages. This is an important topic of study because learning to navigate and apply these packages is often a source of challenge and difficulty to undergraduates studying behavioral science topics (Gliven, 1997).\nThe current findings support previous results about the utility of this type of instructional aid. Here it was found that using the video instruction led to improvements in both the accuracy of the statistical results but also reduced the number of programming errors that were committed. In addition, the video instruction was clearly preferred by users to the instructional manuals.\nFurther research might be done to bolster evidence for the superiority of this instructional approach. However, it is our opinion that the combination of prior research showing its advantage for teaching office workers to function with word processing and spreadsheet programs and the current research showing its advantage for improving the performance of novice data analysts would provide ample evidence that video-based instruction can be expected to outperform instructional manuals in any context."

How do legal actors—including police, judges, prosecutors, and even child welfare workers—make these inferences and approach decisions about which pregnancy losses to investigate as suspected criminal activity? And what factors determine how various officials interpret the meaning of standards like reasonable suspicion or probable cause in this context?\nThe current proposal will explore these issues and discuss the nature of Fourth Amendment restrictions on criminal investigations of abortion-related activity. It will also discuss psychological research on hindsight bias, social perception, and legal decision-making that could be used to help guide courts in their approach to these cases."
