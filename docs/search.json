Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you’ll count the number of cats.\nDiscrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.\nExamples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country."

Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\nWhen you see decimal places for individual values, you’re looking at a continuous variable.\nExamples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature."

When a judge resigns, retires, dies, or is removed from office, the vacant position falls under the discretion of a judicial nominating commission.\nEach judicial nominating commission is made up of four lawyers selected by the Nebraska State Bar Association, four nonlawyers who are appointed by the Governor, and a nonvoting Supreme Court justice acting as chairperson. The judicial nominating commission must not have more than two lawyers or two nonlawyer members from either political party. A judicial nominating commission holds a public hearing to interview candidates who have submitted their names for the open position. The judicial nominating commission submits the names of at least two qualified attorneys to the Governor. Generally, the Governor decides who will become the new judge. However, if the Governor elects not to make an appointment within 60 days after receiving the list of nominees from the judicial nominating commission, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court makes the appointment from the list of nominees.\nQualifications of Judges Applicants for positions on all levels of Nebraska courts must meet a number of requirements in order to be appointed to office. Each person must be a U.S. citizen, be at least 30 years of age, and have practiced law a minimum of 5 years in the State of Nebraska. The person must also be currently admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court.\nThe Judicial Nominating Commissioner’s Manual contains detailed information on the merit selection system.\nRetention of Judges A judge must run for retention in office in the first general election that occurs more than 3 years after their appointment, and every 6 years thereafter.\nWhen a judge runs for retention in office, the question presented on the voters’ ballots states: “Shall Judge [blank] be retained in office?” If more than 50 percent of the voters indicate that the judge should not be retained, the judge is removed."

One interpretation is that despite their legal training, judges are no different than laypersons in being prone to cognitive biases. On the other hand, the lack of real-world context in simulation experiments may artificially inflate the effects of biases. In actual trials, judges weigh inadmissible evidence along with many other pieces of evidence, including arguments by opposing legal counsel, so any effects of implicit biases may be negligible.\nThe Rachlinski et al. (2009) study also hints that when judges have more detailed information or deal with settled legal doctrines, such as those bearing search and seizure, and have more time to consider and deliberate, their training allows them to process information differently than laypersons. Yet, research on actual sentencing decisions in which race is implicated gives us reason to pause.\n\nLandsman & Rakos, 1994; Wistrich et al., 2005Kovera & McAuliff, 2000; Groscup, 2004Guthrie et al., 2001"

A sophisticated understanding of judicial decision making should explicitly incorporate the notion that judges simultaneously attempt to further numerous, disparate, and often conflicting, objectives."

According to the sense-making model, hindsight bias results from biased causal reasoning processes (Pezzo, 2003)\nWhen given outcome information, people try to make sense of what happened and often reinterpret the events leading up to that outcome in a way that makes it appear more inevitable or foreseeable than it would have been beforehand (Yopchick & Kim, 2012).\nThe purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which the sense-making model of hindsight bias explains the tendency for people to overestimate the probability of a successful search in hindsight compared to foresight."

Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you’ll count the number of cats.\nDiscrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.\nExamples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country."

Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\nWhen you see decimal places for individual values, you’re looking at a continuous variable.\nExamples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature."
