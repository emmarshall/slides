Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you’ll count the number of cats.\nDiscrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.\nExamples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country."

Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\nWhen you see decimal places for individual values, you’re looking at a continuous variable.\nExamples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature."

When a judge resigns, retires, dies, or is removed from office, the vacant position falls under the discretion of a judicial nominating commission.\nEach judicial nominating commission is made up of four lawyers selected by the Nebraska State Bar Association, four nonlawyers who are appointed by the Governor, and a nonvoting Supreme Court justice acting as chairperson. The judicial nominating commission must not have more than two lawyers or two nonlawyer members from either political party. A judicial nominating commission holds a public hearing to interview candidates who have submitted their names for the open position. The judicial nominating commission submits the names of at least two qualified attorneys to the Governor. Generally, the Governor decides who will become the new judge. However, if the Governor elects not to make an appointment within 60 days after receiving the list of nominees from the judicial nominating commission, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court makes the appointment from the list of nominees.\nQualifications of Judges Applicants for positions on all levels of Nebraska courts must meet a number of requirements in order to be appointed to office. Each person must be a U.S. citizen, be at least 30 years of age, and have practiced law a minimum of 5 years in the State of Nebraska. The person must also be currently admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court.\nThe Judicial Nominating Commissioner’s Manual contains detailed information on the merit selection system.\nRetention of Judges A judge must run for retention in office in the first general election that occurs more than 3 years after their appointment, and every 6 years thereafter.\nWhen a judge runs for retention in office, the question presented on the voters’ ballots states: “Shall Judge [blank] be retained in office?” If more than 50 percent of the voters indicate that the judge should not be retained, the judge is removed."

One interpretation is that despite their legal training, judges are no different than laypersons in being prone to cognitive biases. On the other hand, the lack of real-world context in simulation experiments may artificially inflate the effects of biases. In actual trials, judges weigh inadmissible evidence along with many other pieces of evidence, including arguments by opposing legal counsel, so any effects of implicit biases may be negligible.\nThe Rachlinski et al. (2009) study also hints that when judges have more detailed information or deal with settled legal doctrines, such as those bearing search and seizure, and have more time to consider and deliberate, their training allows them to process information differently than laypersons. Yet, research on actual sentencing decisions in which race is implicated gives us reason to pause.\n\nLandsman & Rakos, 1994; Wistrich et al., 2005Kovera & McAuliff, 2000; Groscup, 2004Guthrie et al., 2001"

Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you’ll count the number of cats.\nDiscrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.\nExamples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country."

Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\nWhen you see decimal places for individual values, you’re looking at a continuous variable.\nExamples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature."

    "text": "Who are Judges?\nWhat do they do?\nHow do they make decisions?\n\n\nToday I am going to talk to you about the role that judges play in the American legal system and draw attention to some of the research that has been conducted in judicial decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNominated by President\nConfirmed by Senate\nLife tenure with good behavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess varies:\n\nElections\nAppointments\nHybrid Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process used to select judges differs based on what court or court system you are looking at.\nFor the federal courts system, which includes the US Supreme Court, the 13 U.S. Courts of Appeals, the 94 U.S. District Courts, and a variety of other specialty courts and also some administrative article I courts that you honestly don’t need to care about right now… the process is clearly outlined in the Constitution.\nFederal judges have to be nominated by the President and then confirmed by the senate and once they are confirmed they have life-tenure and will continue to hold office during good behavior or until they retire or die.\nThe only way they can be removed from office for misbehavior is through Congressional impeachment proceedings which is incredibly rare and requires both a functioning Congress and a pretty egregious case of ethical misconduct.\nEach state has a unique set of guidelines governing how they select judges at the state and local level. These methods of selection are:\nAt the state level, methods of judicial selection vary substantially in the United States, and in some cases between different court types within a state.\nThere are six primary types of judicial selection:\n\npartisan and nonpartisan elections,\nthe Michigan method,\nassisted appointment,\ngubernatorial appointment,\nand legislative elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartisan\nNonpartisan\n“Michigan method” (hybrid)\nRetention\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\nPartisan election: Judges are elected by the people, and candidates are listed on the ballot alongside a label designating political party affiliation.\nNonpartisan election: Judges are elected by the people, and candidates are listed on the ballot without a label designating party affiliation.\nMichigan method: State supreme court justices are selected through nonpartisan elections preceded by either partisan primaries or conventions.\nRetention election: A periodic process whereby voters are asked whether an incumbent judge should remain in office for another term. Judges are not selected for initial terms in office using this election method.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess varies by state and court level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerit Based (“Missouri Plan”)\n\nState Bar Association\nGovernor\nHybrid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Legislature\nGovernor\n\n\n\n\n\nAssisted appointment Assisted appointment, also known as merit selection or the Missouri Plan: A nominating commission reviews the qualifications of judicial candidates and submits a list of names to the governor, who appoints a judge from the list.[21] At the state supreme court level, this method is further divided into the following three types: Bar-controlled commission: The state Bar Association is responsible for appointing a majority of the judicial nominating commission that sends the governor a list of nominees that they must choose from. Governor-controlled commission: The governor is responsible for appointing a majority of the judicial nominating commission that sends the governor a list of nominees they must choose from. Hybrid commission: The judicial nominating commission has no majority of members chosen by either the governor or the state bar association. These commissions determine membership in a variety of ways, but no institution or organization has a clear majority control. Direct appointment Legislative election: Judges are selected by the state legislature. Gubernatorial appointment: Judges are appointed by the governor. In some cases, approval from the legislative body is required.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies have found evidence that judges…\n\n\nLet political attitudes shape decisions1\n\nMake decisions that maximize policy preferences\nor are consistent with partisan beliefs\n\nReact to electoral pressures in reelection years\n\nMore likely to give harsher sentences2\nor death penalty3\n\nHot button issues (e.g., Abortion rights) 4\n\n\nAttitudinal models of judicial decision making holds that judges make decisions that will maximize their policy preferences, voting in ways that are consistent with their political ideology (Segal & Spaeth, 1993, 2002; George 1998)\nJudges who face reelection or some form of retention election face additional pressures. There is evidence that judicial decision making is influenced by political and electoral concerns.\nStudies have found that in years in which they are up for reelection, judges are more likely to sentence criminal defendants to death (see Brace & Hall, 1997; Brooks & Raphael, 2003; Bright & Keenan, 1995) or to sentence more harshly in general (Huber & Gordon, 2004)\nAlso evidence that certain ideological preferences play a role in politics of judicial elections and can influence judicial decisions (Champagne, 2005; Ware, 1999).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Herbie eligible to run in a Lancaster County Court Judicial election in May 2023? (Explain)\n\n\n\n\n48 Years Old\nDivorced\nUNL Law Class of 2010\nResident of Wahoo, NE\nProud member of the NE Republican Party\nAdmitted to the NE bar in 2012 (still active)\nSpent 10 years practicing law in Nebraska law\nArgued in front of Nebraska Supreme Court in March 2023\nBUT has longstanding personal beef with Sen. Pete Ricketts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybrid system\n\nAssisted appointment + retention elections (3/6 yrs)\n\nQualifications\n\nU.S. citizen\nAt least 30 years of age\nPracticed 5+ years of law in NE\nCan practice before the NE Supreme Court\n\n\n\nYou will also note that in Nebraska this hybrid selection process requires that judicial appointees have at least 5 years of experience practicing law in Nebraska and be a member of the bar (which requires a law degree).\nAppointment of Judges The merit selection system is used for the selection and retention of Nebraska judges. When a judge resigns, retires, dies, or is removed from office, the vacant position falls under the discretion of a judicial nominating commission.\nEach judicial nominating commission is made up of four lawyers selected by the Nebraska State Bar Association, four nonlawyers who are appointed by the Governor, and a nonvoting Supreme Court justice acting as chairperson. The judicial nominating commission must not have more than two lawyers or two nonlawyer members from either political party. A judicial nominating commission holds a public hearing to interview candidates who have submitted their names for the open position. The judicial nominating commission submits the names of at least two qualified attorneys to the Governor. Generally, the Governor decides who will become the new judge. However, if the Governor elects not to make an appointment within 60 days after receiving the list of nominees from the judicial nominating commission, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court makes the appointment from the list of nominees.\nQualifications of Judges Applicants for positions on all levels of Nebraska courts must meet a number of requirements in order to be appointed to office. Each person must be a U.S. citizen, be at least 30 years of age, and have practiced law a minimum of 5 years in the State of Nebraska. The person must also be currently admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court.\nThe Judicial Nominating Commissioner’s Manual contains detailed information on the merit selection system.\nRetention of Judges A judge must run for retention in office in the first general election that occurs more than 3 years after their appointment, and every 6 years thereafter.\nWhen a judge runs for retention in office, the question presented on the voters’ ballots states: “Shall Judge [blank] be retained in office?” If more than 50 percent of the voters indicate that the judge should not be retained, the judge is removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about how you made that decision…\n\n\nIssue: Identify the legal issue/task.\nRule: Locate the relevant legal rule.\nAnalysis: Apply that rule to the facts.\nConclusion: Decision made!\n\n\nYour group went through the process that Law students affectionately refer to as IRAC. And this is really the major components of legal reasoning. So there is almost no point to any of you going to law school now because you can basically do what judges are required to do…right?\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies have found evidence that lawyer judges…\n\n\nDo rely on law and precedent5\n\nConsider fewer extralegal factors\nMitigate own implicit biases with reasoning6\n\nAnd often smaller bias (e.g., hindsight bias7\n\n\nPerceive legal concepts differently\n\nProcedural vs. distributive justice8\n\nMore experienced with legal ethics/practice\n\n\nAs judges make decisions, they must balance their desire to reach the “right’ legal result, their preferences for particular outcomes, and their need to manage their workload as well as other objectives.\nConsistent with this approach there is evidence that the law does influence judicial decision making (Klein, 2002; Rachlinski et al, 2011). However, substantial evidence demonstrates a range of attitudinal objectives–beyond a correct legal holding–that judges seek to accomplish.\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you want to have your case heard before a non-lawyer judge?\n\n\n32 states do not require law degrees (lower courts)\nOften limited by case types:\n\nEviction cases (17 states)\nCriminal misdemeanors (22 states)\n\nNo right to re-trial by lawyer judge (8 states)\n\n\n\n\n\nGreene & Renberg (2021)\n\nMost people assume that judges have legal training and a law degree, but that is not true in many lower level courts in many states.\nAt least 32 states allow at least some low-level state court judges to adjudicate without a law degree, and in fact, there are hundreds of magistrates and justices of the peace in these states wielding substantial legal authority who have never been trained in the law.\nIn 17 states, judges with no law degree are permitted to adjudicate eviction cases.\nIn 22 states judges presiding over misdemeanor cases don’t have to be lawyers, but in at least 14 of those states defendants who receive a jail sentence from a non-lawyer judge have the right to seek a new trial before a lawyer-judge.\nIn Montana, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New York, Texas, South Carolina and Wyoming non-lawyer judges can hand down prison sentences for misdemeanors without the right to a new trial before a judge with legal training.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies have found evidence that lawyer judges can…\n\n\nMake inaccurate factual determinations and verdicts9\nMake (racially) biased sentences decisions10\nAward inappropriate compensation11\n\n\nResearch on judges with legal training has found evidence that they struggle with many of the same cognitive biases that non-lawyers do.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies have found evidence that lawyer judges can…\n\n\nFail to ignore inadmissible evidence12\nInaccurately evaluate:\n\nscientific, expert, or statistical evidence13\n\nExhibit some lay cognitive biases and heuristics:14\n\nanchoring & framing effects\nhindsight bias\nconfirmation bias\negocentric bias\n\n\n\nWhat can we make of these findings? One interpretation is that despite their legal training, judges are no different than laypersons in being prone to cognitive biases. On the other hand, the lack of real-world context in simulation experiments may artificially inflate the effects of biases. In actual trials, judges weigh inadmissible evidence along with many other pieces of evidence, including arguments by opposing legal counsel, so any effects of implicit biases may be negligible.\nThe Rachlinski et al. (2009) study also hints that when judges have more detailed information or deal with settled legal doctrines, such as those bearing search and seizure, and have more time to consider and deliberate, their training allows them to process information differently than laypersons. Yet, research on actual sentencing decisions in which race is implicated gives us reason to pause."

When a judge resigns, retires, dies, or is removed from office, the vacant position falls under the discretion of a judicial nominating commission.\nEach judicial nominating commission is made up of four lawyers selected by the Nebraska State Bar Association, four nonlawyers who are appointed by the Governor, and a nonvoting Supreme Court justice acting as chairperson. The judicial nominating commission must not have more than two lawyers or two nonlawyer members from either political party. A judicial nominating commission holds a public hearing to interview candidates who have submitted their names for the open position. The judicial nominating commission submits the names of at least two qualified attorneys to the Governor. Generally, the Governor decides who will become the new judge. However, if the Governor elects not to make an appointment within 60 days after receiving the list of nominees from the judicial nominating commission, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court makes the appointment from the list of nominees.\nQualifications of Judges Applicants for positions on all levels of Nebraska courts must meet a number of requirements in order to be appointed to office. Each person must be a U.S. citizen, be at least 30 years of age, and have practiced law a minimum of 5 years in the State of Nebraska. The person must also be currently admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court.\nThe Judicial Nominating Commissioner’s Manual contains detailed information on the merit selection system.\nRetention of Judges A judge must run for retention in office in the first general election that occurs more than 3 years after their appointment, and every 6 years thereafter.\nWhen a judge runs for retention in office, the question presented on the voters’ ballots states: “Shall Judge [blank] be retained in office?” If more than 50 percent of the voters indicate that the judge should not be retained, the judge is removed."

One interpretation is that despite their legal training, judges are no different than laypersons in being prone to cognitive biases. On the other hand, the lack of real-world context in simulation experiments may artificially inflate the effects of biases. In actual trials, judges weigh inadmissible evidence along with many other pieces of evidence, including arguments by opposing legal counsel, so any effects of implicit biases may be negligible.\nThe Rachlinski et al. (2009) study also hints that when judges have more detailed information or deal with settled legal doctrines, such as those bearing search and seizure, and have more time to consider and deliberate, their training allows them to process information differently than laypersons. Yet, research on actual sentencing decisions in which race is implicated gives us reason to pause."

They do not act as fact-finders and instead are primarily engaged in the process of judicial review.\nThey face decisions such as whether to grant cert to hear a case or whether to grant en banc review.\nThey also make decisions about whether to ask questions at oral argument and what the nature of those questions will be.\nThey also engage in more opinion writing and, in additional to determining how they will vote in a particular case, must decide whether to join a particular opinion, to write separately, or to author a dissenting opinion.\nThe specific appellate court a judge sits on also impacts the decisions they make. For example, SCOTUS justices exercise more control over their agenda than intermediate appellate judges."

Different models of judicial decision making tend to highlight particular goals.\nThere are various legal realist and critical realist alternatives to this model including attitudinal, strategic and managerial models.\nThe attitudinal models focus on the ways in which judges make decisions that further their preferred policy objectives (Segal & Spaeth, 1993, 2002).\nStrategic models incorporate considerations of the ways that judges seek to effectuate their goals in the long term (Epstein & Knight, 1998; Maltzman, Spriggs, & Wahlbeck, 2000)\nThe best way to think about these models is they each may accurately capture some of what ever judge does some of the time and no single model is likely to describe any judge all the time. A sophisticated understanding of judicial decision making should explicitly incorporate the notion that judges simultaneously attempt to further numerous, disparate, and often conflicting, objectives."

Let’s break this down: Open-source: tools used for research and science that are free and open. Free software means more reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and elimination of cost barriers. You can also see the source code and contribute, too. Scientific and technical: Scientific and technical means that Quarto has specific things for journal articles or scientific papers, like support for code execution, citations, footnotes, scientific markdown, equations, citations, crossrefs etc. We’ll be showing some of these later on, but Quarto definitely has the scientific publishing audience in mind. Publishing system: Quarto is a tool for writing dynamic documents that combine code, output, and text. It can embed output from Python, R, Julia, and Observable. Quarto can be rendered to create high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more formats. Pandoc is the tool working behind the scenes to change Quarto documents to their finalized format. Quarto documents are authored with markdown, which is a plain text format. But Pandoc markdown is very rich and lets you control your document in very specific ways while being easy to read and write. We’ll cover this as well."

Here are some considerations. Quarto has a shared expression for core features. If you used the packages from the R Markdown ecosystem, then you may have had to switch between different ways of doing the same thing. In Quarto, you have a shared core syntax that is the same across all formats. Things like tabset, code folding, cross references in the same way. Another example is that Quarto has a universal theming system based on SCSS for all HTML output where core variables defined by bslib and so it is compatible with Shiny, flexdashboard, and R Markdown themes. So, users can create very consistent and organized theming across content."

Shortcodes let you add content, like fontawesome icons that you have seen in this presentation, or videos from YouTube. Filters let you add new markdown syntax for extended features. And formats are custom formats. There are built in extensions and then community built ones, if you search for Awesome Quarto, there are a list of them there."

Quarto is meant for collaboration either within data science teams or across data science teams. So if someone is familiar with Jupyter Lab, but someone else likes to work in RStudio, they can still work on the same Quarto documents without having to switch to one tool or the other.\nFor RStudio users, Quarto is bundled and preinstalled with v2022.07 and later. There are a lot of features that are built into RStudio for Quarto documents. We didn’t want to limit Quarto enhancements to just RStudio. VS Code has an extension so you can YAML completion and linting and other features for writing Quarto documents, and you can preview documents in Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Labs."

So, say you have a website and you want to change the theme throughout, rather than rendering individual pages you can do that all with one command in a project. Quarto projects also include a _quarto.yml configuration file so that every document in the project inherits the metadata in that file. So, if you think about a blog, you probably want all your posts to have the same theme. If you use the Quarto command for making a new blog, it will automatically be a project, and you can configure the theme for all pages in the _quarto.yml file."

The freeze option specifies if computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or only be re-rendered when their source file changes. Freeze can used when you have either a large number of collaborators or many computational documents created over a long period of time. In these cases, it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have environment-specific requirements or one of your teammates wrote something in Python, which you don’t have installed. Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site."

This means that overzealous police and prosecutors have circumvented the law’s parameters in many states, subtly using criminal laws not meant to apply to allegations of self-managed abortion. Strikingly, regardless of whether these became the final charges, law enforcement considered applying murder or homicide charges in 43% of all 61 cases. These considerations happened twice as frequently in cases involving people of color compared to non-Hispanic white individuals. Racism and stigma infiltrated these investigations and further entrenched them in a crushing criminal process.\nUltimately, the majority of cases proceeded and most often concluded in a guilty plea – unsurprising given how most cases are resolved in the criminal system. But almost a quarter of the cases were dropped or dismissed by either the prosecutor or court. This should motivate advocates and trained criminal defenders to force a review of the charges so clients aren’t wrongly convicted.\nFor anyone entangled in the criminal process, the harm lasts. Conviction or not, several people lost custody of their children temporarily or permanently. In one case, while local authorities declined to prosecute the woman after acknowledging the self-managed abortion was not unlawful, they still turned her over to immigration authorities for deportation."

In ordinary life situations and in court, outcome information might thus distort ascriptions of moral or legal culpability.\nWhat, exactly, is it that drives the outcome effect?\nConsistent with previous findings, the mediation analysis suggests that the outcome effect on culpability is in large parts a consequence of the hindsight bias (see Kamin & Rachlinski, 1995; Kneer & Machery, 2019; Rachlinski, 1998, Rachlinski, 2000): Participants view the subjective and objective likelihood of possible events that actually come to pass as higher ex post than those that do not come to pass.\nIn virtue of the higher perceived risk in the unlucky cases (where the harm does occur), people judge the agents as more negligent and (sometimes) more reckless. Consequently (and reasonably), they deem the agent who is viewed as acting more negligently as more blameworthy. Once subjective probability and negligence are accounted for as mediators, however, no significant direct effects of outcome on blame remain."

(i.e., fetal harm laws or waste disposal provisions)\n\nNearly 1,300 people faced criminalization for pregnancy outcomes, including self-managed abortions, between 2006 and 2020. That’s triple the amount between 1973, when Roe v. Wade was decided, and 2005 (a period more than twice as long), according to National Advocates for Pregnant Women.\n\nIn my comps I plan to focus on three major factors that complicate this situation and creates the risks of arbitrary enforcement.\n\nRates of miscarriage are not evenly distributed throughout the general population. Two factors that have been repeatedly\nUnique history of Roe and anti-abortion movement has created a range of laws that can be used to punish abortion-related activity. (i.e., fetal harm laws or waste disposal provisions)\n\nStudies that have looked at efforts to punish people for their own pregnancy loss before Dobbs found…\nhttps://www.ifwhenhow.org/abortion-criminalization-new-research/ Investigations occurred in 26 states despite the fact that only seven states historically criminalized self-managed abortion; today that number is just three (Nevada, South Carolina, and Oklahoma).\nThis means that overzealous police and prosecutors have circumvented the law’s parameters in many states, subtly using criminal laws not meant to apply to allegations of self-managed abortion. Strikingly, regardless of whether these became the final charges, law enforcement considered applying murder or homicide charges in 43% of all 61 cases. These considerations happened twice as frequently in cases involving people of color compared to non-Hispanic white individuals. Racism and stigma infiltrated these investigations and further entrenched them in a crushing criminal process.\nUltimately, the majority of cases proceeded and most often concluded in a guilty plea – unsurprising given how most cases are resolved in the criminal system. But almost a quarter of the cases were dropped or dismissed by either the prosecutor or court. This should motivate advocates and trained criminal defenders to force a review of the charges so clients aren’t wrongly convicted.\nFor anyone entangled in the criminal process, the harm lasts. Conviction or not, several people lost custody of their children temporarily or permanently. In one case, while local authorities declined to prosecute the woman after acknowledging the self-managed abortion was not unlawful, they still turned her over to immigration authorities for deportation."

According to the sense-making model, hindsight bias results from biased causal reasoning processes (Pezzo, 2003)\nWhen given outcome information, people try to make sense of what happened and often reinterpret the events leading up to that outcome in a way that makes it appear more inevitable or foreseeable than it would have been beforehand (Yopchick & Kim, 2012).\nThe purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which the sense-making model of hindsight bias explains the tendency for people to overestimate the probability of a successful search in hindsight compared to foresight."

    "text": "Criminalization of Pregnancy Loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities used other criminal laws to investigate or punish for abortion-related activity\nMost resulted in guilty plea\n25% dropped or dismissed but collateral consequences remained\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nLost custody of other children - Immigration & deportation - Fines & fees, etc. Pregnant people were already being criminalized for the outcome of their own pregnancies before Dobbs. Nearly 1,300 people faced criminalization for pregnancy outcomes, including self-managed abortions, between 2006 and 2020. That’s triple the amount between 1973, when Roe v. Wade was decided, and 2005 (a period more than twice as long), according to National Advocates for Pregnant Women.\n\nhttps://www.ifwhenhow.org/abortion-criminalization-new-research/ Investigations occurred in 26 states despite the fact that only seven states historically criminalized self-managed abortion; today that number is just three (Nevada, South Carolina, and Oklahoma).\nThis means that overzealous police and prosecutors have circumvented the law’s parameters in many states, subtly using criminal laws not meant to apply to allegations of self-managed abortion. Strikingly, regardless of whether these became the final charges, law enforcement considered applying murder or homicide charges in 43% of all 61 cases. These considerations happened twice as frequently in cases involving people of color compared to non-Hispanic white individuals. Racism and stigma infiltrated these investigations and further entrenched them in a crushing criminal process.\nUltimately, the majority of cases proceeded and most often concluded in a guilty plea – unsurprising given how most cases are resolved in the criminal system. But almost a quarter of the cases were dropped or dismissed by either the prosecutor or court. This should motivate advocates and trained criminal defenders to force a review of the charges so clients aren’t wrongly convicted.\nFor anyone entangled in the criminal process, the harm lasts. Conviction or not, several people lost custody of their children temporarily or permanently. In one case, while local authorities declined to prosecute the woman after acknowledging the self-managed abortion was not unlawful, they still turned her over to immigration authorities for deportation."

According to the sense-making model, hindsight bias results from biased causal reasoning processes (Pezzo, 2003)\nWhen given outcome information, people try to make sense of what happened and often reinterpret the events leading up to that outcome in a way that makes it appear more inevitable or foreseeable than it would have been beforehand (Yopchick & Kim, 2012).\nThe purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which the sense-making model of hindsight bias explains the tendency for people to overestimate the probability of a successful search in hindsight compared to foresight.\n\n\n\nOutcome-sensitivity and Fourth Amendment Analysis\nList types of decisions\nTechnology\nChild welfare workers\n\n\nPsychology of Outcome Knowledge\n\nOutcome bias –&gt; Hindsight bias\nMoral Luck\n\nBlame, culpability and outcomes\n\nWe have argued that the folk-concept of punishment is outcome-sensitive, whereas the concept of blame is not. In ordinary life situations and in court, outcome information might thus distort ascriptions of moral or legal culpability.\nWhat, exactly, is it that drives the outcome effect?\nConsistent with previous findings, the mediation analysis suggests that the outcome effect on culpability is in large parts a consequence of the hindsight bias (see Kamin & Rachlinski, 1995; Kneer & Machery, 2019; Rachlinski, 1998, Rachlinski, 2000): Participants view the subjective and objective likelihood of possible events that actually come to pass as higher ex post than those that do not come to pass.\nIn virtue of the higher perceived risk in the unlucky cases (where the harm does occur), people judge the agents as more negligent and (sometimes) more reckless. Consequently (and reasonably), they deem the agent who is viewed as acting more negligently as more blameworthy. Once subjective probability and negligence are accounted for as mediators, however, no significant direct effects of outcome on blame remain.\n\n\n\nHindsight Bias: Fourth Amendment\n::: columns ::: {.column width=“30%”}"

First, I will examine the legal principles and case law involving inadmissible outcome information that might affect decisions during criminal investigations and prosecutions of pregnancy-based crimes and the role that outcome information plays in decisions made by legal actors in this context.\nNext, I will explore the psychological research that will serve as the theoretical basis for my dissertation. This will include a discussion of the sense-making model of hindsight bias and the closely related literature on the outcome bias.\nI will also discuss research exploring whether other social-cognitive processes, such as attributions of blame and responsibility, and moral luck, play a role in these decisions. Finally, I will outline the series of studies that I plan to conduct for my dissertation."

In ordinary life situations and in court, outcome information might thus distort ascriptions of moral or legal culpability.\nWhat, exactly, is it that drives the outcome effect?\nConsistent with previous findings, the mediation analysis suggests that the outcome effect on culpability is in large parts a consequence of the hindsight bias (see Kamin & Rachlinski, 1995; Kneer & Machery, 2019; Rachlinski, 1998, Rachlinski, 2000): Participants view the subjective and objective likelihood of possible events that actually come to pass as higher ex post than those that do not come to pass.\nIn virtue of the higher perceived risk in the unlucky cases (where the harm does occur), people judge the agents as more negligent and (sometimes) more reckless. Consequently (and reasonably), they deem the agent who is viewed as acting more negligently as more blameworthy. Once subjective probability and negligence are accounted for as mediators, however, no significant direct effects of outcome on blame remain."
