Consequently (and reasonably), they deem the agent who is viewed as acting more negligently as more blameworthy.\nOnce subjective probability and negligence are accounted for as mediators, however, no significant direct effects of outcome on blame remain."

    "text": "Fourth Amendment without Roe?\n\n\nUnderstandably, focus of abortion debate and scholarship is on the implications of limiting access to legal abortion care.\nThis rapid expansion of the scope of criminal liability for abortion raises important questions about how other Constitutional privacy protections, including the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable government searches and seizures, will protect people who experience pregnancy loss in the wake of Dobbs.\nFor example, which facts and circumstances can be used to draw inferences about the cause of a person’s pregnancy loss? How do legal actors—including police, judges, prosecutors, and even child welfare workers—make these inferences and approach decisions about which pregnancy losses to investigate as suspected criminal activity? And what factors determine how various officials interpret the meaning of standards like reasonable suspicion or probable cause in this context?\nThe current proposal will explore these issues and discuss the nature of Fourth Amendment restrictions on criminal investigations of abortion-related activity. It will also discuss psychological research on hindsight bias, social perception, and legal decision-making that could be used to help guide courts in their approach to these cases."

First, I will examine the legal principles and case law involving inadmissible outcome information that might affect decisions during criminal investigations and prosecutions of pregnancy-based crimes and the role that outcome information plays in decisions made by legal actors in this context.\nNext, I will explore the psychological research that will serve as the theoretical basis for my dissertation. This will include a discussion of the sense-making model of hindsight bias and the closely related literature on the outcome bias.\nI will also discuss research exploring whether other social-cognitive processes, such as attributions of blame and responsibility, and moral luck, play a role in these decisions. Finally, I will outline the series of studies that I plan to conduct for my dissertation."

Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you’ll count the number of cats.\nDiscrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.\nExamples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country."

Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\nWhen you see decimal places for individual values, you’re looking at a continuous variable.\nExamples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature."

Discrete variables can only assume specific values that you cannot subdivide. Typically, you count them, and the results are integers. For example, if you work at an animal shelter, you’ll count the number of cats.\nDiscrete data can only take on specific values. For example, you might count 20 cats at the animal shelter. These variables cannot have fractional or decimal values. You can have 20 or 21 cats, but not 20.5! Natural numbers have discrete values.\nExamples of discrete data include The number of books you check out from the library. The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses. The result of rolling a die. The number of patients in a hospital. The population of a country."

Continuous variables can assume any numeric value and can be meaningfully split into smaller parts. Consequently, they have valid fractional and decimal values. In fact, continuous data have an infinite number of potential values between any two points. Generally, you measure them using a scale.\nWhen you see decimal places for individual values, you’re looking at a continuous variable.\nExamples of continuous data include weight, height, length, time, and temperature."

They wrote 7-page set of guidelines for authors. The most recent version of these guidelines, the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 4th Ed., is a bit larger (368 pages), but has the same basic intent.\nAPA format, as we will apply it, has three components:\n1) the content of the report and how it is organized and labeled 2) the format of the report (e.g., margins, citations, tables, etc.) 3) the style of the report (e.g., non-sexist language)"

    "text": "Advantages of Video-Based Software Instruction\nClefton D. Slighter and A. Lindits DeLaroughe Sledver State College\nAbstract: The proliferation of CD-based instructional materials and their avowed success has led several researchers to undertake formal evaluation of the utility of this educational technology. In general, these evaluations have been quite positive. Users often report that the CD-based learning materials are more pleasant and engaging than traditional print materials. In addition, there is some evidence of better learning using the CDs. Our study sought to evaluate the utility of this educational technology for teaching computer-based statistical data analysis. Participants completed a short series of computational exercises guided either by a CD-based presentation or by printed materials. Results were generally consistent with previous findings, supporting the claims of the utility of this technology.\nAs computers, especially desktop computers, became more affordable and were adopted into business and educational settings, there was an immediate need to provide instruction to new users (Slighter, 1983). Previously this need had been met through printed instructional and procedural manuals. While these manuals were sufficient to provide information to computer specialists, it was discovered that they were not as useful for novice computer users (Clayton & Clayton, 1985). Most of the early efforts to improve the information provided to such novices was focused on improving the formatting (Slighter, 1983) and the clarity (Clayton & Clayton, 1985) of the instructional manuals. However, literature reviews by Slighter (1983) and Warkowe (1991) revealed little evidence that these efforts improved the functioning of the printed materials.\nWith the advent of faster computers and better-suited programming languages, the potential for on-computer animated instructional materials was revealed (Tradford, 1988). Newer operating systems that allowed the user to view both the software being learned and the instructional materials on a single screen quickly made these sorts of on-computer instructional materials preferred to video-tape instructional materials that had predominated until that time (Slighter, 1993).\nMany of the early and successful video instructional programs were designed to help novice computer users to become familiar and functional with word processing and spreadsheet programs. Experimental evaluations of these products were common, though of varied quality. The most common procedure was to compare the skills and accuracy acquired from reading the manual with those acquired from viewing a video-based presentation of the material. The results were mixed, but the majority of studies demonstrated that the novice users preferred using the video materials to using the manuals, although there was less evidence that users learned more from the video materials (Warkowe, 1991).\nWhile there have been numerous comparisons of video and written instructional materials for word processing and spreadsheet software, there has been no careful comparisons made with respect to data analysis software. Similarly, while there has been substantial study of the preferences for, and differential functioning of, these types of instructional materials for adult office-workers who are learning new software, there has been no research that allows us to speak conclusively to which type of materials will work best for college and university students who are learning to use a new software product. The purpose of this study was to provide a first examination of this type. Based on the literature cited above, we expected to find that the instructional video materials would be preferred to the print materials and would also lead to greater performance proficiency.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFifteen undergraduates from a large southern state university participated in each of the two training conditions. Students taking “advanced statistics” courses in the Sociology, Psychology and Political Science departments were invited to participate in the project for a $10.00 payment and course credit. The only criterion for participation in the study was that participants must have previously had a statistics or research methods course in which they used SPSS to complete at least 5 data analysis assignments. Separate signup lists were provided to instructors of each class, each of which requested the participation of five males and five females. APA guidelines for informed consent were followed.\nMaterials\nAll participants, working individually, used the academic version of SPSS 9.1 for Windows to complete a single data analysis exercise. The exercise involved entering and saving a 20-case data set including 5 variables, performing various transformations and computing univariate and correlational analyses, and obtaining a printout of the session activities. For those in the instruction manual condition a single copy of the instruction manual provided by SPSS was made available on a desk at the front of the room. The manual includes all aspects of SPSS procedures; approximately 10 pages of which were directly pertinent to the assignment. Those in the instructional video condition were supplied with a copy of the instructional video prepared by the researchers and were given explicit instruction and a demonstration of the portion of the video they would be using. The video was running and visible on the same computer participants in the video condition used to complete their analyses. The full video requires about 45 minutes to complete, however the section pertinent to the assignment requires about 9 minutes to view.\nA 20-item questionnaire was used to collect each participant’s evaluation of the instructional material they used. These included 10 questions about the ease of use of the materials and 10 questions about the quality of information provided by the materials. Each question had three possible responses: 0) poor, 1) adequate and 2) good.\nProcedure\nAll participants completed the procedure in a single computer resource room during one of 10 sessions that were conducted by one of the researchers or one of their four under-graduate research assistants. Sessions included 2-6 participants each of whom was individually assigned to one of the instructional conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to instructional conditions with the single constraint that participants from the Psychology class were all assigned to the instructional manual condition because they had used the instructional CD while in the introductory psychology statistics course.\nParticipants in the instruction manual condition were provided with a copy of the assignment, seated at a computer, and told they would have 20 minutes to complete the assignment and the location of the instructional manual. At the end of 20 minutes they were stopped, and their work saved to be analyzed later. Those in the instructional video condition were provided a copy of the assignment and seated at a computer. SPSS and the instructional video program were opened for them, and they were shown how to navigate between the two pieces of software and how to find the sections of the instructional video that detailed the procedural steps related to their assignment. These participants were encouraged to view the example of each activity required to complete a portion of the assignment, then stop the video and complete that part of the assignment. They were also shown how to replay portions of the video and how to have a video example running while working on SPSS. Before leaving the research session each participant completed the questionnaire.\nResults\nEach participant’s output file was reviewed, and two scores were compiled. The accuracy of their final answers was measured on a % scale. The number of programming errors they made before getting their final answer was also recorded. Responses to the questionnaires were aggregated to form two scores, ease of use and quality of information, each of which was scored on a 20-point scale. For these last two measures, scores for the instruction manual condition were based on the six students in that condition who actually examined the instructional manual.\nTable 1 summarizes the comparison of the instructional manual and video conditions. As can be seen the instructional video led to higher scores on each of the four measures, though the differences were only statistically significantly different for the ease of use rating, F(1, 19) = 4.22, p &lt; .05, Mse = 15.43, and the quality of information rating, F(1, 19) = 3.99, p &lt; .05, Mse = 21.23, and not for the accuracy of final answers, F(1,28) = .98, p &gt; .05, Mse = 4.12, nor for the number of programming errors, F(1,28) = 1.12, p &gt; .05, Mse = 4.42.\n\nDiscussion\nPrevious research has consistently demonstrated the tremendous advantage of video-based instruction for novice users. The purpose of this research was to further examine the utility of CD-based video instruction, specifically its utility for learning statistical software packages. This is an important topic of study because learning to navigate and apply these packages is often a source of challenge and difficulty to undergraduates studying behavioral science topics (Gliven, 1997).\nThe current findings support previous results about the utility of this type of instructional aid. Here it was found that using the video instruction led to improvements in both the accuracy of the statistical results but also reduced the number of programming errors that were committed. In addition, the video instruction was clearly preferred by users to the instructional manuals.\nFurther research might be done to bolster evidence for the superiority of this instructional approach. However, it is our opinion that the combination of prior research showing its advantage for teaching office workers to function with word processing and spreadsheet programs and the current research showing its advantage for improving the performance of novice data analysts would provide ample evidence that video-based instruction can be expected to outperform instructional manuals in any context."

When a judge resigns, retires, dies, or is removed from office, the vacant position falls under the discretion of a judicial nominating commission.\nEach judicial nominating commission is made up of four lawyers selected by the Nebraska State Bar Association, four nonlawyers who are appointed by the Governor, and a nonvoting Supreme Court justice acting as chairperson. The judicial nominating commission must not have more than two lawyers or two nonlawyer members from either political party. A judicial nominating commission holds a public hearing to interview candidates who have submitted their names for the open position. The judicial nominating commission submits the names of at least two qualified attorneys to the Governor. Generally, the Governor decides who will become the new judge. However, if the Governor elects not to make an appointment within 60 days after receiving the list of nominees from the judicial nominating commission, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court makes the appointment from the list of nominees.\nQualifications of Judges Applicants for positions on all levels of Nebraska courts must meet a number of requirements in order to be appointed to office. Each person must be a U.S. citizen, be at least 30 years of age, and have practiced law a minimum of 5 years in the State of Nebraska. The person must also be currently admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court.\nThe Judicial Nominating Commissioner’s Manual contains detailed information on the merit selection system.\nRetention of Judges A judge must run for retention in office in the first general election that occurs more than 3 years after their appointment, and every 6 years thereafter.\nWhen a judge runs for retention in office, the question presented on the voters’ ballots states: “Shall Judge [blank] be retained in office?” If more than 50 percent of the voters indicate that the judge should not be retained, the judge is removed."

One interpretation is that despite their legal training, judges are no different than laypersons in being prone to cognitive biases. On the other hand, the lack of real-world context in simulation experiments may artificially inflate the effects of biases. In actual trials, judges weigh inadmissible evidence along with many other pieces of evidence, including arguments by opposing legal counsel, so any effects of implicit biases may be negligible.\nThe Rachlinski et al. (2009) study also hints that when judges have more detailed information or deal with settled legal doctrines, such as those bearing search and seizure, and have more time to consider and deliberate, their training allows them to process information differently than laypersons. Yet, research on actual sentencing decisions in which race is implicated gives us reason to pause.\n\nLandsman & Rakos, 1994; Wistrich et al., 2005Kovera & McAuliff, 2000; Groscup, 2004Guthrie et al., 2001"

Different models of judicial decision making tend to highlight particular goals.\nThere are various legal realist and critical realist alternatives to this model including attitudinal, strategic and managerial models.\nThe attitudinal models focus on the ways in which judges make decisions that further their preferred policy objectives (Segal & Spaeth, 1993, 2002).\nStrategic models incorporate considerations of the ways that judges seek to effectuate their goals in the long term (Epstein & Knight, 1998; Maltzman, Spriggs, & Wahlbeck, 2000)\nThe best way to think about these models is they each may accurately capture some of what ever judge does some of the time and no single model is likely to describe any judge all the time. A sophisticated understanding of judicial decision making should explicitly incorporate the notion that judges simultaneously attempt to further numerous, disparate, and often conflicting, objectives."

My name is Emma Marshall and I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nToday I am going to talk to you about the research that is conducted and published in the US in the field of law-psychology. To do this, I am going to spend most of my time focusing on a content analysis that Dr. Eve Brank (who you met earlier this week) and her other graduate student did a few years ago. You can see what the entire crew looks like here– the upper picture features Dr. Brank and the primary author on this paper, Dr. Lindsey Wiley at her phD graduation ceremony. In the bottom picture you will see what all of us look like after running a half marathon together! From left to right you will find the other authors of this paper– Joshua Haby (who is very close to finishing his PhD), Dr. Lori Hoetger and Dr. Katherine Hazen. That last extremely tired looking person is me–who isn’t technically an author on this paper because it was finished around the time I first arrived at Nebraska.\nBut I am very familiar with the data and will be walking you through many of the findings using the pronoun ‘we’ for the sake of simplicity. But when I say ‘we’ I am generally referring to the hard work that these fine folks put into reviewing the articles in the field– or more specifically– the articles published within the first 40 years of the flagship law-psychology journal and official journal of the American Psychology-Law Society–Law and Human Behavior."

But what is notable about these official scientific review papers is that they were approved by a committee of AP-LS experts and are meant to objectively summarize the research literature in areas where there is a high degree of scientific clarity and consensus.\nSo far, there have only been three papers approved since this committee was established in the late 1990’s. But as you might notice, these papers only focus on two different topics: eyewitnesses and police induced confessions. What is important to understand about these review papers is that while eyewitness memory issues and coercive police practices are not problems that are unique to the U.S. – the particular policies and procedures that experts are recommending are largely shaped by the particularities of the U.S. constitutions approach to criminal procedure. Specifically as it relates to the rights of criminal defendants in our system.\nAs Dr. Cox talked about in an earlier lecture, this focus on issues related to policing and the criminal law makes sense within the context of the history of policing and the moment towards using incarceration as a means of controlling marginalized populations following the civil rights movement.\nBut the field of law-psychology research–as we will discover from looking at the range of articles published in Law & Human Behavior over the last 40 years– extends far beyond these topics to other areas within criminal law and even to the civil law system.\nSo before we jump into the data it is worth taking a step back and clarifying a few important aspects of the legal system in the United States. As I understand it, Dr. Cox may have already touched on some of these issues so I do not plan to go into much detail. But in order to understand the full scope of law-psychology research in the U.S. it is worth clarifying a few oddities within our system that have inevitably shaped the types of research that is conducted here."

    "text": "Sources of Law\n\n\nCivil Law \n\nCriminal Law\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing that is important to keep in mind about the U.S. legal system is that there are many different sources or types of law that researchers may want to investigate.\nOur laws reflect what is often called a hybrid-system: sometimes we act like a common law or judge/precedent based system and other times we write our laws down in civil law-style codes or statutes. Again, my understanding of the Columbian legal system is limited but I believe that you primary have a civil law based system. Meaning that laws are primarily written down in codes or statutes. And again, we also have that here in the U.S., but there are also many other sources of law; including areas where the rules and regulations are made by the courts and judges based on legal precedent or executive agencies rather than legislators.\nOne reason why I mention this is that some of the terminology we use to describe US system can be confusing ased on their overlapping meaning. For instance, when we talk about their being a distinction between the civil law and criminal law SYSTEMS in the US… the term civil law doesn’t just refer to the fact that the laws are based on a code or statutes written down by the legislature (although often they are). In this context, the civil law system generally refers to the laws and courts in the U.S. that deal directly with disputes that arise between ‘people.’instead the civil law system in the U.S. refers to the laws and courts that deal directly with the disputes that arise between the ’people.’\nThings like family courts for divorce and child custody. Resolving property disputes between neighbors over the location of a fence. Employment lawsuits and contracts between businesses – generally speaking–all of this falls under the category of the “civil law” in our system.\nThis system of civil laws is different from our system of ‘criminal laws’ that generally refer to situations where the government is seeking to punish someone for their conduct. Again, I am over-simplifying things here, but typically when the government is a party in a case or controversy–it is a matter of criminal law.\nAdditionally, just to be clear, while the civil and criminal laws systems are the most well-known and studied, but there is also a separate body of law referred to as administrative law that is governed by an entirely different set of rules and procedures. And as Dr. Cox mentioned there are also many specialized bodies of laws and courts that deal with juveniles or other special issues like immigration that operates outside of the traditional criminal and civil law systems.\nLaw-psychology researchers in the U.S. include people with varying level of familiarity with the complexities of these systems. As Dr. Brank talked about earlier this week, the quirks of the legal system and practice of law in the U.S. is one reason why joint law and psychology programs exist. And given that the many differences between the civil and criminal systems matter a lot in terms of what law gets applies and who gets to make what decisions in what contexts–they also influence the type of law-psychology research that is conducted."

    "text": "Law in the U.S.\nState vs Federal Law\n\n\nAnother structural feature of the U.S legal system that impacts law-psychology research here in U.S. is the unique division of power that exists between our federal government and the government of individual states. The ‘law’ in the U.S. is really best understand as a interconnected web of many different mini-legal systems that are run by semi-autonomous governments that are not required to listen to each other–but occasionally have to do what the federal government says.\nTo make things more complicated we have also further divided our federal court system into 13 different ‘circuit courts’ or regions. These regions look mostly the same today as they did when they were first established in the late 19th century. Except based on the boundaries that made sense when they were first established back in the late 19th century except for: the 10th circuit which used to be part of the 8th circuit and the 11th circuit which used to be part of the 5th circuit. Before they got too big to manage.\nThis means that the the meaning of the ‘law’ or the ‘U.S. constitution’ can vary significantly from colored region to colored region for long periods of time. Until such point at which our Supreme Court (which consists of 9 individuals with life-tenure) can (but only if they want to) weigh in to resolve the dispute. Something to keep in mind about that is very important to remember when you talk about the U.S. legal system is that many of its structures and features are based on what life was like in the late 19th century and therefore makes little to no logical sense to someone viewing the system today.\nThe primary reason for all this is that the U.S. constitution–which has been mostly unchanged for the last 230 years except for a brief period directly following a civil war–established a federal government with limited powers and reserved a lot of the law-making authority to the states.\nAs I understand it, and someone please correct me if I am wrong, but Colombia’s much more recent constitution is also divided into smaller territories that are somewhat like our “States”– but they don’t have their own separate legislatures or court systems. And most of the power to make laws and enforce those laws is given to the central, federal government.\nBut that is not how it works in the U.S. (for better or worse). Instead, each state has the authority to run its own little separate and partially independent legal system that can vary greatly from its next door neighbor. This vertical division of power between the federal government and the individual states is commonly referred to as the U.S. system of Federalism."

    "section": "State vs Federal Law",
    "text": "State vs Federal Law\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason why this idea of Federalism is relevant to the types of research conducted in the US is that it results in a unusual division of ‘state powers’ between the federal government and the states.\nFor example, in general, the criminal law–that is what conduct the government can punish someone for– is a matter that is left up to the individual states. There are some exceptions of course–mostly in the realm of the Federal government’s ability to set policy related to national security– but generally speaking, the criminal law is not something that is uniform across the various states.\nThe reason for this is that our constitution establishes a Federal government with limited powers and then the rest of those powers that a government might need to the states. Including what we call the ‘police powers’ which refers to the power to enact laws that promote the protection of safety, health, morals, prosperity, comfort, convenience and the general welfare of the public. So this means that most of the ‘criminal laws’ in the U.S. is actually referring to 50+ different sets of laws that may work the same way in some contexts but differently in others. And the primary role of the federal government in the criminal law context is to protect the individual Constitutional or statutory rights that all people in the United States have within these various systems.\nNow, if that sounds incredibly and ridiculously complicated and confusing–you would be correct! It is a very confusing system that most people–including people who spent three years in an American law school to become a lawyer– don’t fully understand either. But the key takeaway for all of you should be that the US system of federalism has had a profound influence on the way that the law functions in the US and therefore also the types of research questions that are asked by law-psychology researchers and the willingness of courts and other legal actors to implement ideas and solutions generated from that research."

Well as I mentioned before, one of the best ways to try to understand the range of research is to take a deep dive into the articles published in Law and Human Behavior. There are many reasons why it makes sense to focus on this journal: it is the official publication of the American Psychology-Law Society which is the division of APA dedicated to law-psychology.\nIt is also a great journal because of the quality of editors and reviewers it has in relation to the field. Its focus on encouraging multidisciplinary perspectives and its explicit focus on publishing research that involves the intersection of these two disiplines of law and psychology.\nThe editorial board members for that first issue represented the following fields outside psychology: sociology, criminology, psychiatry, social ethics, political science, law, and anthropology. From psychology, the editorial board members were from a wide variety of areas including clinical, social, and community psychology.\nThe journal is also known for being open to publishing different kinds of research. It publishes original experimental work as well as subject area reviews and theoretical or concept papers. In other words, it is probably the most versatile and important journals in the field.

The only journals that tend to publish research in law-psychology that have a higher impact factor are journals that not law-psychology focused in the same way. Behavioral and brain science and psychological bulletin publish and American psychologist are forums that mostly publishes articles unrelated to the law. And the Harvard law review is primarily a vehicle for legal scholarship that may or may include an empirical or social sciences component.\nAlso, as you can see, the impact factor for Law and Human Behavior is currently 3.87. But it was only 2.82 a few years ago when this analysis was conducted.

This 18% value includes at least three distinct subcategories of witness related research: eyewitness memory (11%), child witnesses (4%) and expert witnesses (4%) that we will take a closer look at in more detail later on. But for now, it is easier to think about all this research within the same category as this topic involves laws of evidence and how courts determine what types of information is relevant or trustworthy in different legal settings.\n\nJury decision-making (15%) - this includes research on both criminal and civil juries.\nPublic policy (9%) – defined as anything related to analysis of a law or public policy\nRisk assessment (6%)\nMental health/mental illness (9%) - defined as anything with assessment, mental health and crime, including issues related to malingering and psychopathy but notably does not include research on competency, insanity, or risk assessment.

For example, some research on the topic of ‘risk assessment’ may focus primarily on certain specialized like ‘sex offenders’. Yet, other research on the topic ‘sex offenders’ may not cover any issues related to ‘risk assessment’ and instead focus on the way that probation/reentry/parole policies or civil commitment statutes are applied to cases involving this population.\nIn other words, because many legal issues are complex and involve multiple areas of the law or target specific populations–research in law-psychology is also (by necessity) similarly complex and multifaceted.

    "text": "Types of “Witnesses”\n\n\nChild Witnesses ~4% \n\n\n\nExpert Witnesses ~4% \n\n\n\n\nWe can break this broader category down into at least three large subcategories: eyewitness memory, child witnesses, and expert witnesses.\nEyewitness memory research accounts for the largest percentage of this category (11%) and sometimes looks very different from research on child witnesses or experts witnesses. But not always. For example, child witness research sometimes focuses on the ways that children process, encode and store information. But other research focuses more on the psychological experiences of children who are asked to testify about something in court. Although much of this research focuses on cases involving sensitive topics like child abuse that are primarily issues of criminal law; other research focuses on the role of child witnesses in domestic disputes such as in family law cases or in civil litigation.\nThe same sort of diversity exists in research on eyewitness memory. Some of this research focuses on how factors like the race of someone or the presence of absence of a weapon might impact the accuracy of peoples memory for an event. But in other cases, such as the scientific review paper I mentioned earlier, researchers are focused more on how specific procedures and practices within the court system impact things like the rights of criminal defendants or the decisions made by judges and juries as fact-finders.\nMeanwhile “expert” witnesses play an entirely differently role in the U.S legal system. Their primary function is to supply courts and fact-finders like juries and judges with ‘specialized’ knowledge that regular folks without domain-specific expertise need in a particular case. This area of ‘witness’ research is one where those distinction between federal and state law and civil versus criminal law creates lots of confusion. The federal court system has an entirely different set of rules and procedures for qualifying an expert or evaluating their testimony than some of the states. Whereas other states just choose to replicate the federal way of doing things. This sort of built-in variation within the law impacts the types of questions that law-psychology researchers ask and explore in their work.\nBut another factor that has influenced the popularity of certain research topics is time."

    "text": "Summary\n\n\n Download\n\n\nMost articles focused on similar topics\n\nFew professional samples\nMostly criminal law\nLimited to social or cognitive psychology\n\nRoom for growth!\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, we found that even though Law and Human Behavior has published articles about a wide-variety of research areas – the vast majority of published articles have focused on a few narrow topics that are relevant to U.S. law. For instance, almost 30% of all articles published over this 40 year period covered one of two topics: eyewitness memory or jury decision making.\nSimilarly, we also found that certain areas of the law were vastly over represented: in particular, most articles focused on the criminal law.\nWe also see there is room for growth in the areas of psychology that we apply to the research – developmental psychology and neuro psychology are both good examples.\nTogether this all suggests that there is a need for the field of law-psychology to expand into new and different areas of research. In fact, for decades leaders of AP-LS have been calling for the field to expand–especially in terms of the legal topics it focuses on. Given that any law that attempts to control behavior is appropriate for empirical analysis. There is a need for U.S. law-psychology researchers to expand to other areas of law that have a significant impact on people’s daily lives. Including family law, the law of contracts, property law and even more specialized topics that span across different systems like public health law."

For instance, almost 30% of all articles published over this 40 year period covered one of two topics: eyewitness memory or jury decision making.\nSimilarly, we also found that certain areas of the law were vastly over represented: in particular, most articles focused on the criminal law.\nWe also see there is room for growth in the areas of psychology that we apply to the research – developmental psychology and neuro psychology are both good examples.\nTogether this all suggests that there is a need for the field of law-psychology to expand into new and different areas of research. In fact, for decades leaders of AP-LS have been calling for the field to expand–especially in terms of the legal topics it focuses on. Given that any law that attempts to control behavior is appropriate for empirical analysis. There is a need for U.S. law-psychology researchers to expand to other areas of law that have a significant impact on people’s daily lives. Including family law, the law of contracts, property law and even more specialized topics that span across different systems like public health law."

    "text": "Sources of Law in the U.S.\n\n\nCivil Law \n\nCriminal Law\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing that is important to keep in mind about the U.S. legal system is that there are many different sources or types of law that researchers may want to investigate.\nOur laws reflect what is often called a hybrid-system: sometimes we act like a common law or judge/precedent based system and other times we write our laws down in civil law-style codes or statutes. Again, my understanding of the Columbian legal system is limited but I believe that you primary have a civil law based system. Meaning that laws are primarily written down in codes or statutes. And again, we also have that here in the U.S., but there are also many other sources of law; including areas where the rules and regulations are made by the courts and judges based on legal precedent or executive agencies rather than legislators.\nOne reason why I mention this is that some of the terminology we use to describe US system can be confusing ased on their overlapping meaning. For instance, when we talk about their being a distinction between the civil law and criminal law SYSTEMS in the US… the term civil law doesn’t just refer to the fact that the laws are based on a code or statutes written down by the legislature (although often they are). In this context, the civil law system generally refers to the laws and courts in the U.S. that deal directly with disputes that arise between ‘people.’instead the civil law system in the U.S. refers to the laws and courts that deal directly with the disputes that arise between the ’people.’\nThings like family courts for divorce and child custody. Resolving property disputes between neighbors over the location of a fence. Employment lawsuits and contracts between businesses – generally speaking–all of this falls under the category of the “civil law” in our system.\nThis system of civil laws is different from our system of ‘criminal laws’ that generally refer to situations where the government is seeking to punish someone for their conduct. Again, I am over-simplifying things here, but typically when the government is a party in a case or controversy–it is a matter of criminal law.\nAdditionally, just to be clear, while the civil and criminal laws systems are the most well-known and studied, but there is also a separate body of law referred to as administrative law that is governed by an entirely different set of rules and procedures. And as Dr. Cox mentioned there are also many specialized bodies of laws and courts that deal with juveniles or other special issues like immigration that operates outside of the traditional criminal and civil law systems.\nLaw-psychology researchers in the U.S. include people with varying level of familiarity with the complexities of these systems. As Dr. Brank talked about earlier this week, the quirks of the legal system and practice of law in the U.S. is one reason why joint law and psychology programs exist. And given that the many differences between the civil and criminal systems matter a lot in terms of what law gets applies and who gets to make what decisions in what contexts–they also influence the type of law-psychology research that is conducted."

My name is Emma Marshall and I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nToday I am going to talk to you about the research that is conducted and published in the US in the field of law-psychology. To do this, I am going to spend most of my time focusing on a content analysis that Dr. Eve Brank (who you met earlier this week) and her other graduate student did a few years ago. You can see what the entire crew looks like here– the upper picture features Dr. Brank and the primary author on this paper, Dr. Lindsey Wiley at her phD graduation ceremony. In the bottom picture you will see what all of us look like after running a half marathon together! From left to right you will find the other authors of this paper– Joshua Haby (who is very close to finishing his PhD), Dr. Lori Hoetger and Dr. Katherine Hazen. That last extremely tired looking person is me–who isn’t technically an author on this paper because it was finished around the time I first arrived at Nebraska.\nBut I am very familiar with the data and will be walking you through many of the findings using the pronoun ‘we’ for the sake of simplicity. But when I say ‘we’ I am generally referring to the hard work that these fine folks put into reviewing the articles in the field– or more specifically– the articles published within the first 40 years of the flagship law-psychology journal and official journal of the American Psychology-Law Society–Law and Human Behavior."

But what is notable about these official scientific review papers is that they were approved by a committee of AP-LS experts and are meant to objectively summarize the research literature in areas where there is a high degree of scientific clarity and consensus.\nSo far, there have only been three papers approved since this committee was established in the late 1990’s. But as you might notice, these papers only focus on two different topics: eyewitnesses and police induced confessions. What is important to understand about these review papers is that while eyewitness memory issues and coercive police practices are not problems that are unique to the U.S. – the particular policies and procedures that experts are recommending are largely shaped by the particularities of the U.S. constitutions approach to criminal procedure. Specifically as it relates to the rights of criminal defendants in our system.\nAs Dr. Cox talked about in an earlier lecture, this focus on issues related to policing and the criminal law makes sense within the context of the history of policing and the moment towards using incarceration as a means of controlling marginalized populations following the civil rights movement.\nBut the field of law-psychology research–as we will discover from looking at the range of articles published in Law & Human Behavior over the last 40 years– extends far beyond these topics to other areas within criminal law and even to the civil law system.\nSo before we jump into the data it is worth taking a step back and clarifying a few important aspects of the legal system in the United States. As I understand it, Dr. Cox may have already touched on some of these issues so I do not plan to go into much detail. But in order to understand the full scope of law-psychology research in the U.S. it is worth clarifying a few oddities within our system that have inevitably shaped the types of research that is conducted here."

For instance, when we talk about their being a distinction between the civil law and criminal law SYSTEMS in the US… the term civil law doesn’t just refer to the fact that the laws are based on a code or statutes written down by the legislature (although often they are). In this context, the civil law system generally refers to the laws and courts in the U.S. that deal directly with disputes that arise between ‘people.’instead the civil law system in the U.S. refers to the laws and courts that deal directly with the disputes that arise between the ’people.’\nThings like family courts for divorce and child custody. Resolving property disputes between neighbors over the location of a fence. Employment lawsuits and contracts between businesses – generally speaking–all of this falls under the category of the “civil law” in our system.\nThis system of civil laws is different from our system of ‘criminal laws’ that generally refer to situations where the government is seeking to punish someone for their conduct. Again, I am over-simplifying things here, but typically when the government is a party in a case or controversy–it is a matter of criminal law.\nAdditionally, just to be clear, while the civil and criminal laws systems are the most well-known and studied, but there is also a separate body of law referred to as administrative law that is governed by an entirely different set of rules and procedures. And as Dr. Cox mentioned there are also many specialized bodies of laws and courts that deal with juveniles or other special issues like immigration that operates outside of the traditional criminal and civil law systems.\nLaw-psychology researchers in the U.S. include people with varying level of familiarity with the complexities of these systems. As Dr. Brank talked about earlier this week, the quirks of the legal system and practice of law in the U.S. is one reason why joint law and psychology programs exist. And given that the many differences between the civil and criminal systems matter a lot in terms of what law gets applies and who gets to make what decisions in what contexts–they also influence the type of law-psychology research that is conducted."

    "text": "Law in the U.S.\nState vs Federal Law\n\n\nAnother structural feature of the U.S legal system that impacts law-psychology research here in U.S. is the unique division of power that exists between our federal government and the government of individual states. The ‘law’ in the U.S. is really best understand as a interconnected web of many different mini-legal systems that are run by semi-autonomous governments that are not required to listen to each other–but occasionally have to do what the federal government says.\nTo make things more complicated we have also further divided our federal court system into 13 different ‘circuit courts’ or regions. These regions look mostly the same today as they did when they were first established in the late 19th century. Except based on the boundaries that made sense when they were first established back in the late 19th century except for: the 10th circuit which used to be part of the 8th circuit and the 11th circuit which used to be part of the 5th circuit. Before they got too big to manage.\nThis means that the the meaning of the ‘law’ or the ‘U.S. constitution’ can vary significantly from colored region to colored region for long periods of time. Until such point at which our Supreme Court (which consists of 9 individuals with life-tenure) can (but only if they want to) weigh in to resolve the dispute. Something to keep in mind about that is very important to remember when you talk about the U.S. legal system is that many of its structures and features are based on what life was like in the late 19th century and therefore makes little to no logical sense to someone viewing the system today.\nThe primary reason for all this is that the U.S. constitution–which has been mostly unchanged for the last 230 years except for a brief period directly following a civil war–established a federal government with limited powers and reserved a lot of the law-making authority to the states.\nAs I understand it, and someone please correct me if I am wrong, but Colombia’s much more recent constitution is also divided into smaller territories that are somewhat like our “States”– but they don’t have their own separate legislatures or court systems. And most of the power to make laws and enforce those laws is given to the central, federal government.\nBut that is not how it works in the U.S. (for better or worse). Instead, each state has the authority to run its own little separate and partially independent legal system that can vary greatly from its next door neighbor. This vertical division of power between the federal government and the individual states is commonly referred to as the U.S. system of Federalism."

    "section": "State vs Federal Law",
    "text": "State vs Federal Law\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason why this idea of Federalism is relevant to the types of research conducted in the US is that it results in a unusual division of ‘state powers’ between the federal government and the states.\nFor example, in general, the criminal law–that is what conduct the government can punish someone for– is a matter that is left up to the individual states. There are some exceptions of course–mostly in the realm of the Federal government’s ability to set policy related to national security– but generally speaking, the criminal law is not something that is uniform across the various states.\nThe reason for this is that our constitution establishes a Federal government with limited powers and then the rest of those powers that a government might need to the states. Including what we call the ‘police powers’ which refers to the power to enact laws that promote the protection of safety, health, morals, prosperity, comfort, convenience and the general welfare of the public. So this means that most of the ‘criminal laws’ in the U.S. is actually referring to 50+ different sets of laws that may work the same way in some contexts but differently in others. And the primary role of the federal government in the criminal law context is to protect the individual Constitutional or statutory rights that all people in the United States have within these various systems.\nNow, if that sounds incredibly and ridiculously complicated and confusing–you would be correct! It is a very confusing system that most people–including people who spent three years in an American law school to become a lawyer– don’t fully understand either. But the key takeaway for all of you should be that the US system of federalism has had a profound influence on the way that the law functions in the US and therefore also the types of research questions that are asked by law-psychology researchers and the willingness of courts and other legal actors to implement ideas and solutions generated from that research."

Well as I mentioned before, one of the best ways to try to understand the range of research is to take a deep dive into the articles published in Law and Human Behavior. There are many reasons why it makes sense to focus on this journal: it is the official publication of the American Psychology-Law Society which is the division of APA dedicated to law-psychology.\nIt is also a great journal because of the quality of editors and reviewers it has in relation to the field. Its focus on encouraging multidisciplinary perspectives and its explicit focus on publishing research that involves the intersection of these two disiplines of law and psychology.\nThe editorial board members for that first issue represented the following fields outside psychology: sociology, criminology, psychiatry, social ethics, political science, law, and anthropology. From psychology, the editorial board members were from a wide variety of areas including clinical, social, and community psychology.\nThe journal is also known for being open to publishing different kinds of research. It publishes original experimental work as well as subject area reviews and theoretical or concept papers. In other words, it is probably the most versatile and important journals in the field. But it is by no means the only journal that people go to publish law-psychology research."

So the higher the number, the more that journal was circulated and read.\nThis table can therefore give you an idea of how important Law and human behavior is to the field. The only journals that tend to publish research in law-psychology that have a higher impact factor are journals that not law-psychology focused in the same way. Behavioral and brain science and psychological bulletin publish and American psychologist are forums that mostly publishes articles unrelated to the law. And the Harvard law review is primarily a vehicle for legal scholarship that may or may include an empirical or social sciences component.\nAlso, as you can see, the impact factor for Law and Human Behavior is currently 3.87. But it was only 2.82 a few years ago when this analysis was conducted.

This 18% value includes at least three distinct subcategories of witness related research: eyewitness memory (11%), child witnesses (4%) and expert witnesses (4%) that we will take a closer look at in more detail later on. But for now, it is easier to think about all this research within the same category as this topic involves laws of evidence and how courts determine what types of information is relevant or trustworthy in different legal settings.\n\nJury decision-making (15%) - this includes research on both criminal and civil juries.\nPublic policy (9%) – defined as anything related to analysis of a law or public policy\nRisk assessment (6%)\nMental health/mental illness (9%) - defined as anything with assessment, mental health and crime, including issues related to malingering and psychopathy but notably does not include research on competency, insanity, or risk assessment. It is also worth noting that 4% of this 9% includes papers specifically focused on the psychopathy…but I have combined the two categories today for our convenience as we attempt to grapple with the wide-variety of research topics covered by the field.\nThe final highlighted area of research is Juvenile law (4%) which I believe Dr. Cox talked about at length.\n\nThe other 36% of research focused on one or more of the 27 others categories of research topics I refer to as “all other” on this chart."

For example, some research on the topic of ‘risk assessment’ may focus primarily on certain specialized like ‘sex offenders’. Yet, other research on the topic ‘sex offenders’ may not cover any issues related to ‘risk assessment’ and instead focus on the way that probation/reentry/parole policies or civil commitment statutes are applied to cases involving this population.\nIn other words, because many legal issues are complex and involve multiple areas of the law or target specific populations–research in law-psychology is also (by necessity) similarly complex and multifaceted. Take for example the most topic of ‘witnesses’ that accounted for 19% of the research articles."

But not always. For example, child witness research sometimes focuses on the ways that children process, encode and store information. But other research focuses more on the psychological experiences of children who are asked to testify about something in court. Although much of this research focuses on cases involving sensitive topics like child abuse that are primarily issues of criminal law; other research focuses on the role of child witnesses in domestic disputes such as in family law cases or in civil litigation.\nThe same sort of diversity exists in research on eyewitness memory. Some of this research focuses on how factors like the race of someone or the presence of absence of a weapon might impact the accuracy of peoples memory for an event. But in other cases, such as the scientific review paper I mentioned earlier, researchers are focused more on how specific procedures and practices within the court system impact things like the rights of criminal defendants or the decisions made by judges and juries as fact-finders.\nMeanwhile “expert” witnesses play an entirely differently role in the U.S legal system. Their primary function is to supply courts and fact-finders like juries and judges with ‘specialized’ knowledge that regular folks without domain-specific expertise need in a particular case. This area of ‘witness’ research is one where those distinction between federal and state law and civil versus criminal law creates lots of confusion. The federal court system has an entirely different set of rules and procedures for qualifying an expert or evaluating their testimony than some of the states. Whereas other states just choose to replicate the federal way of doing things. This sort of built-in variation within the law impacts the types of questions that law-psychology researchers ask and explore in their work.\nBut another factor that has influenced the popularity of certain research topics is time."

For instance, almost 30% of all articles published over this 40 year period covered one of two topics: eyewitness memory or jury decision making.\nSimilarly, we also found that certain areas of the law were vastly over represented: in particular, most articles focused on the criminal law.\nWe also see there is room for growth in the areas of psychology that we apply to the research – developmental psychology and neuro psychology are both good examples.\nTogether this all suggests that there is a need for the field of law-psychology to expand into new and different areas of research. In fact, for decades leaders of AP-LS have been calling for the field to expand–especially in terms of the legal topics it focuses on. Given that any law that attempts to control behavior is appropriate for empirical analysis. There is a need for U.S. law-psychology researchers to expand to other areas of law that have a significant impact on people’s daily lives. Including family law, the law of contracts, property law and even more specialized topics that span across different systems like public health law."

My name is Emma Marshall and I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nToday I am going to talk to you about the research that is conducted and published in the US in the field of law-psychology. To do this, I am going to spend most of my time focusing on a content analysis that Dr. Eve Brank (who you met earlier this week) and her other graduate student did a few years ago. You can see what the entire crew looks like here– the upper picture features Dr. Brank and the primary author on this paper, Dr. Lindsey Wiley at her phD graduation ceremony. In the bottom picture you will see what all of us look like after running a half marathon together! From left to right you will find the other authors of this paper– Joshua Haby (who is very close to finishing his PhD), Dr. Lori Hoetger and Dr. Katherine Hazen. That last extremely tired looking person is me–who isn’t technically an author on this paper because it was finished around the time I first arrived at Nebraska.\nBut I am very familiar with the data and will be walking you through many of the findings using the pronoun ‘we’ for the sake of simplicity. But when I say ‘we’ I am generally referring to the hard work that these fine folks put into reviewing the articles in the field– or more specifically– the articles published within the first 40 years of the flagship law-psychology journal and official journal of the American Psychology-Law Society–Law and Human Behavior."
